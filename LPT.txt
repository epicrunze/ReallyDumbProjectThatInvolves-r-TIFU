Woooo my first ever gold! Thanks stranger ❤ Merry Christmas everybody

EDIT 2: Sad to see how low people can go by sending me threats etc lol. To those of you who got the message in a good tone, Have a good one!/nhttp://i.imgur.com/GOCpO4I.jpg/nEdit 1:Woo, front page! All from a stoner moment while listening to black keys - weight of love. 
Love you all!

Edit 2: Obviously this isn't meant to be a blanket statement or a diss towards black keys. Just a way to maybe find some new music. 
Also look into the song writers, or anybody else that was involved with that specific track. /nWhoa! Front page! And all because I stumbled back in my house, half-asleep and jet lagged from Vegas and noticed my house really smells like my dog. I have so many people to thank! And so many dogs to thank! Like mine, for example. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold! And to the rest of you, uh, go Bears and Trubisky is the future. /nMore examples: If you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4. 

Or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be  3. 

Explanation: Commutative Property. So, 0.07 times 50 will always equal 50 times 0.07.

I hope you found this interesting and/or helpful! 

**Edit #1:** Thank you for the gold! 

**Edit #2:** You can also solve percentage problems by multiplying the two numbers (7 times 50, which equals 350), and then taking the product and dividing it by 100 (so the answer would be 3.5). Thank you to everyone who pointed out this alternative method. /nThis only affects the display on your browser, but it's a simple way to bypass the infuriating "create an account" or GTFO situation on shitty websites when you just need quick info

Edit: This post got more traction than I was expecting. I’d really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where I am. I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

Plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!/nEDIT: Wow, this blew WAY up. And my first time on the front page too. 

I guess I can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what’s worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me.

As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper. 

TL;DR- I’ve never had two people or websites give the same advice about resumes. Everyone’s going to want it different. *Generally* in the US, the physical resume could afford to be shorter because it leaves room for conversation if called for an interview. /nSince this has gained a lot of popularity, I want to add in that anyone with questions should visit the good people of r/Greyhounds.

They can help you decide if you're ready for a retired racer, prepare you for the difficulties that come with adopting one, and clear up any questions you may have about the breed. They can also give you some insight into how retired race dog rescue works. Dogs are a big responsibility that you shouldn't take lightly, but if you prepare yourself and do your research you can face the challenges with confidence.

There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, "boot camp" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the "job lottery" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an "open" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. "No thanks" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist "open general", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying "DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but "Go to college if you want a good life!" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already./nEdit: Thank you stranger for this Gold.

Edit: u/PaintersOfBlindFaith Thank you for the proof, http://imgur.com/qEa6qei/nYes, bring on the inevitable and endless masturbation comments. /nWow didnt think this would blow up over night, thanks for all the advice anyone.

I personally graduated an electrical apprenticeship at a shipyard after failing out of college twice.  I wish I found the apprenticeship straight out of high school, but my school, and I'm sure many others, really pushed you to get a degree.

I now work for a military contractor making a pretty good wage.  I encourage anyone looking to get into an apprenticeship to reach out to their local trade union. Not only will they provide quality OJT, but most places will provide a free college degree like mine did./nIf you've ever struggled with layout consistency between .word, .docx, .txt, and Google Docs, this is for you.

Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

This has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

EDIT: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't MEAN that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. Either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

I am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

Edit 2:

As this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: Yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. Hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. Open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. We are aware of pirating websites, I promise.

An example of what I'm talking about here is that I used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. Often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated I was doing it. I stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. Now I only do it if I feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

These are all things *I* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way./nBoth professionally and in my personal life, I know a bunch of people that refuse to admit to having made a mistake. When I mess up (and we all do at some point,) I just own up to it right away.

Edit:  So as a few people pointed out,  adult dogs are not perfect and can come with some quirks.  Make sure you do your research and are fully prepared to take on the responsibility of a pet whether it's a puppy or an adult.

Please adopt responsibly.

For mildew odors you can double and triple this amount. Hot or warm water works best. I have a top loading machine — I let the drum fill with water and put the vinegar in once it fills, right on top of the clothes. I’ve had my washing machine over 10 years and vinegar hasn’t shortened the life of my machine or my laundry for that matter.

It’s the best. /nObviously this only works if you shout loudly ("OWW!") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

I've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. Cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. For example, I have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and I can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

Similarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. This goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. Properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to./nEver notice how homeless people who have dogs - their dogs are amazingly calm, follow their owners everywhere?

Honestly, in many jobs you could practically skate by just being a delight to your co-workers. /nhttps://old.reddit.com//nI’m not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. But the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. If people laughed at their joke. If people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. If people agreed with their opinion. 

So the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they’re boring is: you don’t need to put so much pressure on yourself. Honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you’re talking to. Listen. Ask questions/follow-up questions. Laugh at their jokes. And they’ll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to. 

Edit: for those saying isn’t this just ego-stroking or being fake, it’s not about sucking up to the other person at all. It’s just empowering you to worry less about what you’re saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway.

I just wanted to clarify that this advice is directed at people who have made the decision to hold off on crying until another time, for whatever personal reason, not to discourage people from crying./nEdit: I posted at lunch and just got home from school to find this. This is the most polarized comment section I have ever seen. I'm so sorry/nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

TL/DR:  Don’t Ask/nIn the business world we should all be having conversations, however in my experience this is very rarely the case, mostly it is arguments. So how do you change this? The first step is to point out the above. Ultimately this entire situation is caused by the ego, a universal variable most managers never take into account. Try to separate yourself from your idea and present it in a way that is purely beneficial to the company, if you do this enough times your ego will eventually be rewarded.

Edit: Agrument...I know...believe me when I say it is irritating me more than it could possibly irritate you :)/nFor more information, check out ReverseTransfer.org(https://reversetransfer.org/)/n&#x200B;/nUnless they are raging alcoholics, then you do you. /nLike me most of you are probably sick of playing a free game then a pop up appears asking to rate the app? Apple have put in an option to turn this off (asking to rate is automatically on by default) so they can’t ask you anymore. To turn this off on iOS 11, go to settings and tap ‘account’ at the top then ‘iTunes and app store’ at the bottom there’s an option to turn off in-app reviews.

Edit: this is still in beta and is a new feature by Apple. Companies had to put in rating notifications for themselves before but Apple are phasing out apps being able to do there own in app review notifications and replacing it with this Apple feature which you can turn off.

My first Gild! Thank you! /u/Jkuz/nI recently moved into a condo and have a 100mbps plan, but my wifi was only getting 4Mbps using Speedtest.

Using Wifi Analyzer showed I was on Channel 6 along with about 6 others.

Channel 11 only one had one other, so I changed my wifi signal to use channel 11. Immediately after I ran Speedtest and got 87Mbps.

Second Edit:

Wow this got bigger than expected. Thank you for the gold kind stranger. 

It doesn't seem to work on every Android device. I'm on a Nokia 8 and have tested it multiple times now and it definitely works.

Sometimes you have to additionally press play on the lockscreen for it to work.

As several people mentioned there are multiple third party apps that may do a better job at this./nSometimes parents who are disgruntled with their children's grades will sell their console as a punishment. A friend of mine was able to get a PS4+games for $100 this way./nCheck the settings and security options on the website or on mobile./nIt also can save you multiple trips to the vet.

Edit: Was not expecting this to blow up this much! I do need to give credit to my own vet for suggesting I do this when I brought my cat in and he wouldn't cough and hack like I was claiming he was doing... jerk...

Also, a lot of people recommend to record illness episodes to show Dr's and a lot of other suggestions for warranties and such.

And, of course, thanks for the gold and silver, internet strangers!/nIn an old job in "Corporate America" I had a manager who would always share with employees encouragement and kind words of praise within earshot of other employees, and would offer words of critisicm and suggestions for improvement in private (in his office or a conference room). This set up an environment of positive reinforcement and gave employees respect and honesty they needed to perform at a higher level.


Edit: Good call by /u/slumdawg11b for pointing out that this applies to any leadership role, and /u/airforcefalco that it applies to parenting. 


Edit 2: Lots of folks rightfully expressing that this is a catch-all method and knowing your employees' personally to effectively give praise and discipline is the best way to go./nsimple.wikipedia.org
/nAlso helps with cleanup (no cheese stuck to plate).

Edit: RIP Inbox!  Glad so many of you enjoyed my LPT!  And thank you for the golds, kind strangers--may you always pick the nacho stuck to other nachos (after all, it's still one nacho).
/nNote: *This is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

I was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*


Edit 1

**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


Edit 2

**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  Especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**Moisturizers & Chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/FatJennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  I will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing./n[Source before someone asks](https://redbooth.com/blog/walking-productivity-scientific-links)

*kelly has joined the chat*/nSomething I started for my own family around last year, which I think more people should do.  Call it a heirloom book or something.

Asking for advice that'll be useful so far into the future ensures that it'll be timeless, and gives people a chance to pass on their wisdom and be remembered long after they would otherwise be forgotten.  You can fill it with all sorts of stuff, from stories to family recipes to general LPTs.  Make extra copies whenever you have to pass it down to multiple children, too./nThis is a heartfelt move especially if they didn't take many pictures as a family and it may let them see a side of their loved one they didn't know about./nI’m from New Orleans where flooding is common. Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). It creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown. 

Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

Another thing to consider are keeping food, water and an axe with you if forced to move to a higher level of your home. Many people got stuck and even drowned in their attics during katrina but the people who brought axes could cut through to their roofs./n> Edit : Since this is getting some visibility, I want everyone to know that this post doesn't explain all the dangers of rip currents, nor does it depict how they exactly appear all the time. i just wanted to share a side of the danger that may be interesting to be careful about. The most important thing to keep in mind is to **not try to fight back against the current**, **swim sidewides to break out of it**. Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.

People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

A friend of mine died getting caught in a rip current last Saturday. Awareness literally saves life./nI've recently realized this is the root of most of the communication issues with my friends and family. I would try to explain something, for example: how to run the new dishwasher. If they failed to understand the process, I would get angry (not at them, just in general) and they would see it as a critique of their intelligence. The discussion would quickly turn into an argument and in the end everyone would just hate the new dishwasher. 

So I started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. It totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person I was talking to more receptive to my instructions. Instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity. 

/nHad to use this against Mediacom to stop them from applying “Tech-Fees” and “One-Time-Charges” to my bill. /nAs I am about to enter my grad school I have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. 

[**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

[**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

[**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. 

[**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)

I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...

It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

[**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

[**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**Bonus Tips That I Learned**


***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying. 

***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.

I'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out! 

**Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!

Good luck in your studies my friends!
_________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: Cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. Also added Flu.x per KreekyBonez as it is one I think people should be aware of. 
_________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: Thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than I expected! Glad to help. Wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.

I hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. Otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course!
/nI read an article about this several years ago and it has helped me tremendously.

I can't find the original article I read, but here is a good one from Psychology Today: 
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/200905/if-you-want-succeed-don-t-tell-anyone

Edit: Thank you Redditor for finding the original article that I read! - http://berkeleysciencereview.com/when-telling-others-about-your-goals-compromises-them//nIn the USA, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

Keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- Workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- Agricultural Laborers   
- Airline employees   
- Supervisors (who aren't classed as "employees" for this purpose)  
- Independent Contractors 

While it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in Human Resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

Keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

Also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

Telling someone who has worked at your place of employment longer, that you make a lot more than them can have a potential impact on how they see you in a work environment. However, this can also give them a reference and bargaining chip during a yearly review./nI'm no professional but I've been doing this for a while now and it hasn't failed to get a genuine smile rather than a forced 'photo face'./nBecause scents are among the most powerful memory triggers. /nEdit: I've ALWAYS wanted to say this, but RIP inbox.

This has proven true in the case of this hunter.  His truck was found stuck in a ditch one day after he was reported missing, but unfortunately he has yet to be found./nYou don't need to be poor or homeless, but this seems like it will benefit those who are the most.

And im not telling you to become their crutch (which may drag you down if you're not in the best place yourself)

Im letting you know, that after three weeks a lot of people with the best intentions slowly get back to their own lives, which may leave the hurt person lonely and in a bad place.
Just be aware, dont pummel them with questions, but make sure to ask once in a while, let then know you are there if they need you. Just be attentive and help where you can, be a friend. They'll need you more than ever./n Edit: I'm talking about the INITIAL excitement, people.  When they're telling you the idea is the peak so just let that die down a bit first before pointing out the possible obstacles.  And whether the idea is good or bad doesn't matter......it's for the people who THINK the person's idea is bad and want to poke holes in it. /nThe phrase "I assumed..." has a very negative connotation, and people will view it as you jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.




On the other hand, if you use the phrase "My understanding was...", it has a way more positive connotation. Plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.



This is best applied in a workplace/professional environment. If you tell your boss that you "assumed" something typically results in a reprimand; saying "My understanding was..." will instead just be viewed as a miscommunication./nVerizon, Comcast, etc all require their representatives to make multiple attempts to save the account.

EDIT: Yes, you should check meat for an internal temperature prior to eating, should that be it's own LPT?

Got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.

Our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. We used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. After using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

Bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

Double bonus: Aim it at your SO and say you found something hot.

You can get them on Amazon shipped right to you and the batteries last forever, enjoy!

EDIT 3: It's clear from this thread why warning labels and EULAs exist.

No this isn't a 100% perfect item, it's cheap and does a few things and is neat. Don't eat raw/undercooked meat. People are weird, including myself. 

 

Another poster kindly sent this to explain the (approximate) zone of temperature reading:

I’m way too late to get seen in your thread but I wanted to add the ir scanner makes a cone of scan. Some are 12:1, 16:1 or even 30:1 so the distance from the scanned surface will reveal the average temp of a circle 1/12 diameter the distance to the object. 12 ft away makes a 1 ft circle, 24’ = 2’ circle etc./n 

It happened to us when I bought my first used car at a VW dealership. We were discussing the sale price and he left us to "talk about it" while he went to "run some numbers" by the finance manager. I had given an offer of $1000 below their asking price as that is what I could afford. My mother said she could chip in $500 more if that would help me out. 

He came back and said his "boss" could meet in the middle, $500 off sale price.  We were quite happy about it all and it was done.

Later on I got an office job with the exact same phones the dealership had. Found out the green light button was lit when the phone was active, and the microphone on./nIt shows that you truly care about what they have to say and that means so much more than you’d think. This will do wonders for making friends as well as improving relationships in general.

Everyone wants to be heard, but nobody wants to listen./nEdit: WOW! Front page! I'm on cloud 9 right now. 

To answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. Laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. Inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. Kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

As for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options. 

I mostly despise how the companies are gouging consumers. /nWell a post that I cropped from r/ULPT is my highest upvoted thing so cool.../nAlways have a plan for your success: this means doing work that you are  good at, and having someone available to do your job so you can be  promoted to your next job./nThis includes cakes. You can just say it’s for a party before the wedding. Same cake. Hundreds of dollars cheaper.

Edit: I guess I need to clarify a bit. If a vendor is attending the wedding, don’t try to bamboozle them. This is for stuff that you pick up (Tents, chairs, cake, lights, etc.)

Any vendors coming to the wedding should be prepared that it’s a wedding (band, photographer, caterer etc)./n**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, "fun" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

The things I have in mine include:

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

\- Iodine tabs for water

\- Beef jerky

\- Energy gel

**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*/nJust make sure you tell your carrier it’s for them, or leave a note, otherwise they generally won’t take it. Heat indexes are outta control right now and I promise you, your mail carrier is sweaty and miserable.

Many people looking for homes to rob will come to your door asking about security systems. It gives them a chance to case the home and look for weaknesses like if you don't have a dog or if the house is homed by women or the elderly.



Edit: Great advice from /u/OA27


>Furthermore, document the encounter to the best of your ability. This is not the time you want to shoo someone away immiediately. Be comfortable being uncomfortable and without escalating the situation, ask as many questions as you can. Who are you with (even if they lie, they likely have told that lie before), contact numbers, etc. Did they come in a vehicle? Take the plates down, make, model, any damage to the vehicle. Which direction did they go in, did they talk to any neighbors.

I'm definitely pleasantly surprised this blew up like it did. Never knew that chip bag opening could be such a hot topic.

Aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.

Also agree from a health standpoint, the better LPT is probably to eat fewer chips :-P But nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.

Thanks again folks! Fun way to end the weekend :)/nSeriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. Dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on Netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.

For example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box "COOK ON HIGH FOR 3 MINUTES LET STAND AND SERVE" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says "COOK ON 1/4 POWER FOR 12 MINUTES" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *TWELVE WHOLE MINUTES* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.

You all also seem to be the type of person who would blast their shit in the microwave anyway, because s frozen curry being cooked through in the oven in 20 mins from turning the oven on would mean using a blast furnace. Also, did the title say "if you're choosing how to reheat something...?" No. It doesn't. Because I'm SPECIFICALLY addressing **Microwave** usage, so outta here with your faux superiority, go make your own thread about ovens and toaster ovens and airfryers. Not everyone has those things - dorm students may have a cooktop and convection microwave.

This is just for when you're initially seeing the car.

He said most people will excessively worry and over-analyze a decision, but then do very little about it after the decision is made. We spend 95% of our energy pre-decision, then 5% after. However, he said a lot of the science shows that very often there isn't a "right" decision, but there are things we can do after that will make it right. For example, don't feel like there's a right/wrong decision to make when considering a job offer out of state. If you do decide to take it, once you're there do things to "make it" the right decision, like go out and make friends, work hard but keep a good work/life balance, etc. Change that 95/5 split to more like 50/50.

EDIT: Wow, my first reddit gold! Seriously, thanks!/nAdolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. Before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. Thus, our "true personality" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

Before that happens, people are often "in lust" rather than in love, but without realizing it. Our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. This can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

So don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!

Some facts for y'all.

Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

This post was created because my sister wanted to gift 1 bunny to my nephew and i had to talk her out of it, so please don't gift bunnies they are a fuckton of work.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet/nA lot of times baking instructions give you a bake time that leaves them in until the cookies are completely done baking. People then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt. 

So unless you like gross hard cookies, TAKE YOUR COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN WHILE THE CENTER IS STILL GOOEY. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE BRINGING HARD COOKIES TO POTLUCKS WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEIR COOKIES ARE ACTUALLY BURNT.

The one day we shouldn’t celebrate them is Memorial Day./nAs a dry cleaner, I can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. If a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
It take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. That is if all the stains came out on the first try. Most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. And that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
Usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. They have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
In summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
Before, it was possible cause Perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from Perc by now, especially in California. 
So if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (I've been in the business for 16 years. )/nI used to work for an ISP B2B sales team. They paid us well for selling rented Modems because usually they were used, given back by the last renter. Or if they renter didn't return them, they still have to replace it with a new one. So it was recurring revenue without a cost to the ISP 

And no, there is no advantage to renting. They don't service Modems rented differently than one you bought
___________________

Edit: To address everyone saying that their ISP "requires" use of the company's router, or that techs cost money:

Ive seen reps say the ISP modem rental was required, thats pushy sales tactics -most of the time. Just tell them emphatically you want to buy your own. **The router/modem model is important, make sure you ask your ISP what model/combo to buy**

Techs are no cost when its first installed because its the outside lines, into your house. The same goes for internet issues. You again, emphatically tell customer care that the issue is not with the hardware but with the wiring outside/to your box. They are pushy, like the car repair business. They know most people dont know better, so they embellish on facts and swindle a lot of people out of money due to ignorance

If I feel like my browsing time is getting out of hands again, I usually look at the clock, round up to a nice, even number and set the shutdown time for the difference in seconds. 

Say it's 11:52 pm, I type "shutdown -t 480" and keep browsing until my PC forces me to quit at exactly midnight.

Windows will notify you 2 minutes before it finally shuts down, and if you changed your mind you can issue the command "shutdown -a" to cancel the shutdown process.

Just downvote and move on /nThis is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think "how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. 

I'm not talking about classic "nice guy" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

*********

**Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds. And you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do./nYour hair cells are fragile. Protect them. I made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made. 

Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. 

EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google "tinnitus definition" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

"[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)" 

Stay safe everyone. 

EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! 

As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. 

Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~"Etymotic"~~(just search for "earplugs that don't muffle sound") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said "Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed." However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. 

Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just "disappears". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless. /nParticularly good to know for those in the East, without access to BLM land.

I was usually busy or distracted and would not do my best to follow up with him.

He died today. Won't discuss the details but it was not of natural causes. 

If it seems unusual, give him or her the proper time of day. Otherwise you will have to carry this wrenching feeling of knowing you could have done something more. Stay safe, and don't be afraid to ask directly for help if you need it.

As a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


So i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. My friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


My mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.

Edit 2 : as some pointed out, try not to be a "job hopper", this depends heavily on the industry you are working in though.


Edit 3: this is not a golden a rule, use your own brain, only you know your situation best - just don't let loyalty for a company ever be the biggest priority, your career should be your priority./nCarriers use multiple completely different frequencies for different generations of cellular technology.

I'm in my last year of college and realized I typically just google'd all my questions that I had as I figure out living on my own. This past year though, I've been texting her all my silly little questions: "How can I get X stain out of my carpet easily?"  "Do you know any home-remedies for a sore throat?"

It might seem really trivial, but I think anyone would love to know that you still rely on them and not only appreciate their advice, but seek it out too. 

Have a great day! :)

* First you will want to find some dark skies near you with a website like: http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.


* Next, Check this: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/ and put in your chosen location to see when the ISS passes overhead. 


* And then, a few days before, You will want to check the night sky forecast at http://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/ to check on cloud cover.

It's rare but some people will get that perfect Santa flying overhead on Chrismas Eve but for others, you can say something along the lines of "*I got a hot tip that Santa is doing his famous practice run to stretch the reindeers legs before the big night...*"

A lot of subjects are covered and it's all free. Happy learning!

Edit: Thanks for the gold, y'all!/nI absolutely hate having to move my cursor or my mouse to skip the intro and hitting S is super easy and quick. God bless for the skip intro button tho. /nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every new number is the sum of the two previous ones in the series.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
The next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

Edit: You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). The ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio. Hence, the Fibonacci sequence provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles./nYou'll refill your happiness meter in no time AND do some good/make a cooped up dog's day!/nMy in-laws are accountants and we were talking about taxes this past weekend. Since I just started a business, I asked if I could hire them to prepare my taxes. The response I received was very eye opening; my mother-in-law said, "I'll take care of it and give you the family discount, but I want to thank you for offering to pay...most of the family EXPECT us to do their taxes for free."

EDIT: Obligatory "I can't believe I made the front page of Reddit!" - I'll be sure to tell my mother-in-law (to which I'm sure she'll reply, "huh?" 

Sorry if I didn't include your profession, but I love hearing all the responses. On a personal note, my father was in the trades and would always help out friends/family/neighbors with simple repairs. However, in return, he would always ask if they could donate their time to [Habitat For Humanity](http://www.habitat.org/) for a local build. Don't want to get to preachy, but [HFH](http://www.habitat.org/) is a really great organization and if you ever get a chance to volunteer on a build, I highly recommend it.

EDIT2: Great replies, keep 'em coming! Apparently, IT professionals are in demand and tired of hearing, "I have one small favor to ask you..." from friends/family.

For those who think expecting to get paid is greedy, I would advise to at least offer some food, gas or you could trade services. My father once helped a welder remodel his bathroom and in exchange he received a new wood stove for the sauna./nMost people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view. But that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience. 

Say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it. Think about which you'd rather hear. 

Mediocre apology: 
"I'm so sorry! I just got startled when my phone buzzed and I accidentally knocked it over. It was totally an accident. I feel terrible."

Good apology:
"I know you really like the look of that couch, and now it's got a stain on it - you must be really bummed about that. I'm so sorry. I'd be happy to pay for a cleaning, and in the future, I'll keep my drinks in the kitchen. 

Edit: Reading through the comments, I think I should clarify. I'm talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said, and want to clear the air with an apology. This is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong, or don't want to apologize. 

Edit 2.  Well. Had I known anyone would actually read this, I probably would have put some time into thinking of some better examples! I'm super new to reddit, so this has been interesting. 

I went though the first couple hundred responses and got some rough numbers, as follows:

1. This is a pretty good idea, I will contribute some further thoughts or information: 12%

2. I like this. Nothing further. 11%

3. This is the right idea, but Jesus H. Christ, your examples are terrible. 8%

4. I will tell a joke. 7%

5. You gotta have some explanation, or else how are they supposed to know what you're apologizing for? 7%

6. I wish [person in my life] did this. 7%

7. You plagiarized this from Jimmy John's/Dr. Laura/Daniel Tiger/other. 7%

8. You gotta also do something else (ask forgiveness, actually do something to make amends, etc.). 7%

9. And for the love of FSM, never say "I'm sorry you feel that way" or "I'm sorry, but..." because that's awful. 6%

10.Apologizing sucks. 6%

11. This would not be appropriate for every situation. 5%

12. This is a terrible idea. 4% 

13. Something about Trump. 3%

14. I have my Google JD and/or my cousin's wife's stepmom is a lawyer, and therefore I have determined that you'll be legally liable. 3%

15. Here's a link you won't click. 3% 

16. This is just as stupid and repetitive as the rest of the thoughtless dreck on this wasteland of a sub. I'M LEAVING. 3%

17. You are a robot/HR person/narcissist/ neckbeard fuckboy/passive-aggressive jerk. 2%

Percentages rounded. /nIt may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

Edit: Couple of things that have come up

1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure "efficiency" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.

Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is "Seek first to understand" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.



/nEdit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who got something from this. That's all I wanted and I'm glad I could help a few people out today. :)/nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to make it to the front page. 

From what I'm seeing in the comments, a lot of redditors have some pretty terrible employers. IMO, if your relationship with your employer is so adversarial that their response to you knowing what you're worth and asking to get paid as such, is for them to fire you out of spite, I wouldn't be hanging around at that job even if they did give me the raise I want.

Some employers are great and will happily give you what you're worth, a lot of employers are scumbags who who try to milk you for everything you're worth while paying you jack shit, but plenty of employers are simply businessmen trying to get the best value for their buck, but will pay a valuable employee what they're worth if it makes good business sense./nEdit: According to rural veterinarian we talked to over the weekend it is fairly common at this time of the year for people to bring in animals ( mainly fawns ) that were hit or even ran over by various lawn mowers. /nI do this often! All I do is walk in and ask the receptionist if I can come inside and pet the kitties. They *always* say yes! 

I usually sit in the kitty room for an hour playing, petting, interacting, and bonding with them. The kitties love it because they need attention and I love it because I can tell how much they’re loving it. 

For me, going there sets me happy for the rest of the day!

Sometimes you get to see them being picked to be adopted too, which always warms my heart. (:/nIf you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. It does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. It does not take long and it makes a visible difference. 
If you struggle with 15, do 10. If 15 make you smile do 20.

Edit: Because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: This is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.  
The LPT is meant to be: Even a tiny workout can go a long way. Warm up. Mix it up. But don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. There is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. You can see that difference and you can feel it. Some say even a few dong chin ups every other day can go a long way .../nFuneral Directors are businesses like any other and will usually prey upon mourning vulnerable loved ones. The family of the deceased feel bad "cheaping out" and will buy any expensive services suggested to them. Do your mourning family one last favour and take the choice away from them.

Or as /u/FluffyBlizzard suggests; just buy it beforehand.

EDIT: DeathProTip, AfterlifeProTip ..... please, no more./nEDIT: If someone is clearly depressed, prefers alone time, or needs your help before something bad happens, this is not the tip for you to follow. Please reach out to that person and let them know you care. I've been on that end and it is so reassuring to hear from someone even if you don't feel like being around anyone.

But if you have friends who you consistently try to make plans with, they decline or take a rain check with a "oh we'll have to hang out soon" and never get back with you, yet you see them out with other friends all the time, then yes, this is very applicable. You deserve better friends./nThrusting an animal on someone forces them to take care of another life but not everyone can afford to give it the life it deserves.

This really only applies to suburban residents, and is only particularly useful when it is day time. Nevertheless, I understand the controversy. This LPT is only for a select few, sorry if it doesn't apply to you/nI've been having a tough time recently and doing this has helped me a lot. 

Edit: I just wanted to say that, even though they are just random internet points, it makes me feel good that this post did so well and that there have been so many nice comments. I hope that this advice might help someone. 

Also thank you for the comments about the animal shelters and the dog walking apps. I had not though about those options and they are great ideas!!

/nIf you put two commas after the phone number followed by the extension, your phone will call the number, pause, then dial the extension.


Edit 1: Thanks to u/vonaudy who explained how it works.
Each comma is 2 second pause, so you can place 3 commas to have it wait 6 seconds before sending the extension.

You could also take multiple breaks like 
555-555-5555,,7,,,,,45,,7890#

And thanks to u/bizzattles for mentioning the semi colon which prompts you on screen to send the extension when you want to.

Edit 2: credit to u/provanilla. To get the comma key when on the dial pad, you need to press and hold the * key.

Saving Private Ryan. If you are a fan of the movie I highly recommend starting with this one... total game changer for me.

EDIT UPDATE:  Many have pointed out the subtitles are only as good as the people typing them, but after a lot feedback from industry professionals I thinks the odds are very good the subtitles are more adequate than my ability to hear it correctly without them.  Also, there seem to be some downers who “who have been doing this for years”, and to you I say, why didn’t you share your LPT sooner?? I could have been doing this for YEARS.

EDIT UPDATE 2:  Thank you so much to everyone commenting and contributing to the conversation!  I have seen so many great ideas about how to use this to learn a language and how to watch movies with a newborn/any age child in the house!/nI have rewritten the title to make it slightly clearer, since some people were having trouble with it (and my pride as a linguist can't take it):

**Whenever you have any work done on the house, always insist that the contractor tell you where all the materials and parts they have used were sourced from. If you ever need spare/replacement parts in the future, you might not be able to find out where to get them from because your contractor might not be around any more.**

I have followed my own advice sometimes (e.g. writing down paint colour codes) but I have a roller blind that has been broken for two years now because I can't find the place where the contractor got them from (they are unbranded) and he won't return my calls./nIt's spring so it's baby season.  Most mamma animals find a spot they feel is safe and leave their babies while they get food, sometimes it's for hours.  Leave wild baby animals be, they are tougher than they look.

&#x200B;

Exceptions obviously apply.  If the babies are in danger, show signs of infection or injury, do try and get them help.  If they are in danger, see if you can move them to a safer spot (take a look online to get specific tips for that animal) before getting a rehabilitation center involved. /n[Like so](https://i.imgur.com/SFR7puf.jpg)/nEdit: Wow I didn’t realize this had such an “impact” on so many people. (Please excuse my shit pun) 

But for those of you wondering how to learn please take the advice of other redditors and take some martial art classes,  skate/snowboarding lessons and one major way I learned was air awareness lessons on trampolines./nAs a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. It's not always about money. Maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.

However, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. Management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. If half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.

Also, accepting a counter offer is NOT the end of the world as many would have you believe. It's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.



EDIT: Wow. Compensation is always a touchy subject. A few things to understand before you continue to assume that I am the world's worst manager.  

1. Someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  We get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  It's usually a small bucket.  I also never have the power to walk into HR and say "Hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. Oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?"  In fact, I have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  

2. Seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled "top performer" is underpaid.  I can assure you that that isn't the case.  Many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  Go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...

3. Remember employment is a mutual agreement.  Everything is in play.  If you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  There is nothing wrong with that.  /n1. Bin bag = trash bag/rubbish bag/garbage bag.
2. You don't HAVE to use cat litter. You can use shredded paper, baking soda, dryer sheets, whatever.
3. In my country we only have trash collection one day a week, so I can't change my bags every day.
4. Unscented cat litter is a thing.
5. The litter goes in the BAG guys/nUsing each syllabus, extract the date that every assignment, quiz, test, paper or project is due for each class. Fill in your calendar or day planner with this information, making sure to list everything that is due each day, for each class, for the whole semester.

By doing this, you will prevent yourself from being blindsided by deadlines. I fill out a new wall calendar with all of this information at the start of each semester and it has helped me tremendously. Wall calendars are generally inexpensive and will cost you less than $5. 

Whether they are quizzes, exams, or even which chapters need to be read before each class, having a weekly template of what you need to accomplish or prepare for will set you up for success.

I recommend using pencil, as some professors will change the dates of things due to the pace of the course or weather interruptions. This has helped me be a better student, and I hope that it may help some of you!

Edit: Thank you for the feedback about electronic scheduling. It seems like a great option as it can be taken with you wherever you go, and updated on the fly. I will likely start doing this too. The point of this post is to help students become more organized and aware of their academic responsibilities, as not everyone uses these tools. I used to fly by the seat of my pants, and noticed a big difference in my success when I began doing this./nIn Air Force basic training the training instructors would turn on the lights and we'd jump out of bed and make the bed in seconds. Then they'd tell us to get back into bed, turn off the lights, and do it again (good times).

After ten or twenty repetitions in a row, your body gets the idea.

I used this recently to teach myself to hang up my coat when I get in. Enter home, walk to closet, hang coat on hanger. Grab coat, walk back out of home. Repeat ten or so times and it replaces 'chuck your coat wherever' reflex.

Edit: wrong version of hanger. Not where we kept our airplanes./nYour friend will greatly appreciate you thinking of them, and may also be able to clear their schedule to allow them to go. 

This also prevents said friend from feeling left out, and they can't be angry for not being invited, should someone post things on social media or them just find out in general. 

EDIT: /u/newsfan had a great point: It always feels better to turn down an invitation than to not be invited at all.  
EDIT2: /u/TomilloT has a great point: an invitation could potentionally cause serious stress and anxiety in some people. When inviting anyone, especially when you know they can't go, always make sure they know there's no pressure to go./nGood for the laundromat too./nSometimes it's better value to order a large instead of two mediums.

LifePizzaTips/nEDIT: To sum up what I think were some great comments: 

- There are many great dogs who need homes in shelters. Go follow your local humane society on Facebook. 
- *NEVER* get a dog from a pet store. 
- Apparently this LPT applies for other animals as well (e.g. Parrots)

And just to clarify, puppy mills and responsible breeders are very, very different. See this article for a great write-up: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-dog-factory-inside-the-sickening-world-of-puppy-mills-w457673/nHeard this advice somewhere online a while ago and as somebody who does a lot of photography it's one of the best pieces of advice I've heard./nI took a course on civic courage (?) last week and we were taught to not approach the perpetrators when we see a dangerous situation in public -- that would not help the victim, and would just lead to us getting punched in the face too. Instead, we're supposed to reach out to the victim, address them by name and ask them to come with us. This gets them out of the situation without needlessly endangering you.

Example (we watched a video on this): Two drunk guys enter a subway car and start bullying a skinny young guy reading a book (taking the book away, not letting him get up). Another passenger goes over (but doesn't get too close) and says, "Hey, Peter, I haven't seen you in a while, why don't you sit with me? How's the girlfriend?"

The people doing the workshop were former policemen and say this works 9 out of 10 times.

If nothing else, call 911. Don't look away.

Edited to add: As I said in multiple comments below, while I did learn this in my civic courage workshop last Saturday, the post today on TwoXChromosomes gave me the idea to post this LPT. So you guys can stop linking to that post, suggesting I "got the LPT" from that post, implying I'm "riding the coattails" of that post etc. I just want to get the word out there about an unusual and effective way to defuse a situation./n**EDIT** 
Important note to this. Only Registered Dietitians or RDNs (registered Dietician Nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose & treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, & conditions such as eating disorders & deficiencies. 

1) Some or most people might spell it Dietitian, not Dietician. Unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.


2) YMMV. Certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. AFAIK in  most parts of the US and UK, Nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a Dietitian or Registered Dietitian.  In almost all cases, anything like "Diet Coach" or "Nutrition Coach" or "Heath Coach" or "Nutritional Specialist" are bs terms. Main takeaway from this LPT is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) I'm not intending to imply that there aren't any Nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. Just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike Dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. I'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable Nutritionists and Nutritional Therapists out there...and some terrible quack Dietitians. Again, do your research and be careful who you trust.
/nEdit: I also believe saying, "I'm not sure, but let me find the answer for you" is definitely a great way to explain that you don't know the answer in a professional/work environment./nThat way if one piece breaks, you can easily swap it out without having to order a part. Most 3D printers have at least a half dozen parts built from 3D printed parts. Also, make sure that the first thing you print after replacing a part is another one of those parts./nBelieve it or not, the vast majority of Arguments are based on miscommunication.  

With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) Not understand the other person's argument

2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

Something like, "Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?"

Now this has several benefits.  

--First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  This is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--Secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--Thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually "listen" and "hear" what they are saying.

--Fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

You can also do the reverse.  Pause the argument and ask "Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?

This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    And again, it helps to actually help define the EXACT problem.../nMany shelters have programs where individuals can foster a pet free of charge.  The shelters will pay for the pets' vet bills and food, and in exchange (a) the pet lives with you; and (b) you agree to bring the pet to adoption events so that others can consider providing the pet a forever home.

This allows you a "test run" to see if you're ready to adjust your lifestyle to the needs of pet ownership, without the worry associated with (a) the cost of pet ownership, or (b) the potentiality that you decide you're not ready for pet ownership.

/nUnder-promise, over-deliver (UPOD).  Not new advice, I know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    These are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an M.D. Ph.D. in Neuroscience/Neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, I under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) Realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). People often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) UPOD only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  You shouldn’t tell your SO that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **Don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  If you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to "offer" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  This is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  Although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody’s fault but your own.  First of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over UPOD with them again.  Many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  Second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually OPUD (Over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  You might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) When starting out, **Buffer UPOD with "I wish" statements**.  I have 4 kids, and with my M.D. Ph.D. training, I literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  At the beginning of each school year, I remind my kids that although I wish I could make it to every event, I will not be able to attend everything. Every time I show up, my kids are totally stoked.  I sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know I can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  Although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, I have found quite the opposite.  I have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that I say I will be at. 

5.) When employing UPOD, **Focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  For instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with "I really wish I could go, but I probably can't.  Could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?"   When a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know “I will check with the Chef to see if I can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  However, I can bring you some free extra breadsticks that I can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.”   

6.)  **You can maintain an optimistic attitude while still UPOD-ing to yourself**.  I just realized that UPOD-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  I used to always tell myself that I would get more work/homework done over Christmas vacation.  Turns out, I was always disappointed at how much I actually got done.  Now, before the break, I tell myself I will be happy to get 10 or so hours’ worth of work done each vacation period. If I get more done, I am pretty proud of myself.   For instance, even though I spent about an hour putting this post together, I am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  This is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success I have, it is worth it (also, I plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **Under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  Realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  Teach them, in gentle ways, how to UPOD. 

8.) **In some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are UPOD-ing**.  Example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a Friday evening).  I say “some instances” because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  For example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  For instance, you don’t need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

I apologize if this felt like a lecture, I just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before I had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    Thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, I am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of UPOD.

Tl;DR:  Under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

Edit:  Thanks for my first Reddit Gold!!!  
Edit:  The driving example was  probably a terrible one, just the first one that came to my mind.  My wife is a very patient person, this was just the first example that came to my mind (my wife usually just wants to know when I am home and if they should start dinner with me wait a bit).  She is my rock.  I have also supported her in her career goals and am supporting her through school right now as well!  I am very thankful when she UPOD to me as well.  
Edit:  For those wondering, I have finished my Ph.D. and have a few years left of medical training.  Thanks for the well wishes.

After you complete your tasks, you'll feel better, or you'll at least keep those things from ruining another day. /nI get a lot of spam calls at work for people selling home security, and usually I tell them "this is a business" and they get embarrassed and hang up. But today someone called with the same spiel but then tried to then pivot to talking about business security instead. Pretty obviously someone trying to set-up a scam. Remember just because they're on the phone and sound like they could be miles away, don't take it for granted.

EDIT 2: Yea the obvious thing is to not answer numbers you don't know or to hang up immediately. The point is if you find yourself in this situation, answering safely won't be your first instinct. Maybe now it will be.

EDIT 3: For anyone wondering, the responses largely breakdown into a few categories:

1. Don't answer the phone/just hang up.
2. I don't need security I have guns/dogs.
3. Tell them to come so you can use your security/guns/dogs.
4. Yes this actually happened to me/someone I know/this is useful.
5. This would never happen/is not useful.

It's that 4th category that makes it all worth it! I appreciate your stories. Not trying to paranoid, just trying to help :)/nDoing this will not only give you an idea of the skills you need and which courses to take, but makes you reflect if the job description sounds like something you'd want to do everyday in the future.

Edit: thanks for the support, differing (but equally helpful) opinions, and the gold/nRealized this the other day, and I wish I had figured it out years ago. My family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from Knology (now WOW) for over a decade. After fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though I don't know the cable/phone details, I do know we were only getting 20 Mbps down/2 Mbps up internet speed. That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.

On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.

Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. WOW seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but I can't speak for any other ISP./nTaught to me by my parents, I do this in my relationship. Telling your SO goodnight especially after a fight tells them that you value your relationship more than you are upset about whatever thing is making you upset.

Edit: Holy moly, guacamole. I did not expect this LPT to take off so much. I got a bunch of great responses, both positive and critical, and I like both because it means that this LPT made people really buckle down and think about their relationships and how they handle them. 

This LPT made it to the front page of Reddit, which is hella exciting! Anyway, thank you to all who took part in the discussion!/nI got a call from someone claiming to be from fraud department of my bank over the weekend. The call showed up on my caller ID as US Bank which is how I have it saved in my contacts. He said there was a fraudulent charge from American Airlines and I was on that their website booking a flight about an hour prior to the call. 
For a moment I thought it was legit but then he asked for a pin #. 
Just be careful because the caller ID makes it seem real. The actual fraud department said they have seen this multiple times with the caller ID showing as the bank. :/ 
edit... Hey thanks to everyone that shared a story or gave advice! I appreciate everyone's input :)/nI should *have* said 'but with less guilt or calories' as opposed to "without the guilt or calories". But never mind. Still though it was a great snack to have during an unbearably hot August this year.

Happy to see quite a few other people agree or will try it out /nTo have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.

For example: If you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

If you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. Anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

Instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. This will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
[EXTRA PROTIP: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. Even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.]

What this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. When unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

I never have to do much in my room. My closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. I have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. It works for them but I don't think thats an efficient method.

Of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

EDIT: Massive response, thanks! The point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

Also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. It's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
EDIT 2: When you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. This makes you less likely to clean as you go. Whats the point when you can do it later? So the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.
Also i missed a word in the title, sorry!

He had helped many through the grieving process. When a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, I asked him what I should do to help them.  He taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  Meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to "normal life" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(Note , I have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).


To be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless.

A small pot.(I don't pay attention to actual sizes, so let's just say one of those little ones that are perfect for one ramen.)

Water, filtered or unfiltered- Doesn't fucking matter but fancy blogger type people will say filtered. (I fill it to about an inch and a half below the top)

A few shakes of cinnamon powder. (cinnamon sticks if you wanna get fancy)

As many drops of essential oil as you like. I use peppermint oil, balsam fir needle, or orange oil.

If you don't have essential oils and don't want to buy any, cinnamon alone smells really great and festive as well!

You can also add sliced fruit like apples or oranges if you wanna go all out. 

Enjoy feeling like a festive ass adult who's killin it at having your shit together and making your house smell like Christmas./nMy meal planning and grocery shopping habits are something I really pride myself on. Over the last 3 years, I've worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area, therefore saving me a lot of time and money. I thought I would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area. Please feel free to share any additional tricks you have!


**Get started.**

Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.


**Meal planning**

1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an "easy" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.

2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money. 

3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 "fend for yourself night" and 1 night of eating out. 

4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.  

5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a "grab n go" breakfast. 


**Make your grocery list**

1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.

2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.

3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)

4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week. 

5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request. 

6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce. 


**Get to the store**

1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!

2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.

3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.

4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!

5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* "buy one get one half off" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.


There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.


**Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**

1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.

2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.

3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning. 

4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration. 

5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.

6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration,  but I change them depending on my preferences. 

6. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.

7. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.

Edit: sorry guys I really dont know how to format so I've had to mess around with this a lot!

**EDIT 2:** I've gotten some requests to share a sample meal plan. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4s-npIJ0K85RktBMkF1dEduZ1lfV191bHhNcUo3dkVwUHp3/view?usp=sharing) is an example. It's not fancy at all! This is from a couple months ago, so I've made some changes to my eating habbits since then! Not drastically different than what I outlined in my post. /nInstagram tries to make it difficult to save photos outside of the app, but there's a pretty easy workaround.  

Let's say you want to save this image to your desktop: https://www.instagram.com/p/BTO_dCkhxdQ/  

Load it in it's own browser tab (I'm using Google Chrome), right click and select "View Page Source" (Ctrl+U): http://imgur.com/a/T45dd  

Then in the page source search for "og:image". That URL links to the raw file. Copy and paste that image URL into a new tab and do with it as you wish! http://imgur.com/a/LWWQl/nIf you're a big procrastinator, this is a great and easy way to start fixing that problem. If it's something like taking out the trash, folding some clothes, or putting the dishes away, do them right there and then and don't put it off. If it only takes 2 minutes, get it out of the way!/n
The random act of giving flowers can mean so much more than when they're expected./nEdit: wow! Would've never guessed that I would reap karma from a ramen life pro tip. Now I guess I'm gonna have to stock up before all you redditors buy my ramen/nDon't deny it. Deep down, you always knew you could. You've just not gotten round to it, and we're putting up with it for absolutely no reason.

You can do it in under 10 seconds. It's okay. You got this./nUpdate:
Yes, of course you don’t have to be a renter to do this. I directed it toward renters because it is an inexpensive and easily reversible solution. Also, low-flow shower heads and water pressure issues are very common in rental properties which leads me to...

Apparently there is a very serious difference between water “pressure” and “flow.” This is a solution to the low “flow” issue, but most of you understood what I was trying to say anyway. Sorry for offending you water purists.

Additionally, don’t go out and buy anything super expensive for this. I can’t remember the model name of my shower head but it was about $20 and is Waterpik brand.

Happy showering!/nEDIT: So, now I know what "RIP my inbox" means. Holy ratfuck./nMy cat was lost and I got this great tip from the local vet.

(for the people buying me silver or gold, please save your money and go for a walk with one of the dogs in your local shelter instead)/nEdit: I meant "too busy", not "to busy". People at the gym aren't going to busy :c/nIf you are just blindly asking, you’re putting them on the spot and they either won’t think of anything, or give you crap tasks that don’t further your progress in the company.  

If you come to them with a specific task in mind, especially if it’s for a problem or issue you’ve identified and you already know how to correct it/complete the task with ease, it will get you a lot further.   It also shows a great deal of initiative and will have them start thinking of you for things in the future. 

Edit:  A lot of you are interpreting this as just doing something and not asking.  I fully meant it to come off as asking your boss first.  I only meant it as it being a lot better to come to your boss with something in mind for a problem you have identified, rather than just walking up and blindly asking.   

Edit 2:  there’s a lot of negative people here saying you just get overworked/not rewarded.  All I have to say to that is, sometimes you’ve got to get shit on before your seed will sprout. /nAlmost all support live chat systems provide a "Sneak Peek" feature that allows a customer support agent to see what you're typing in realtime before you submit. This can work against you if you're negotiating a resolution and type something (however brief) that gets taken the wrong way. Keep your in-progress thoughts outside of the chat!

Edit: vendor links/nThis works if you're alone, with a partner, a friend, dog, etc.   You'll get a new appreciation for your city, and you'll get some exercise.   The wife and I started this   a few weeks ago, and it's been awesome.

*edit* for aditional ideas.  What I did when I set this up was to pick 26 nature type places, and 26 commercial ones.  So depending on our mood and the weather we dip into the relevant hat and off we go.  All you need is a pair of shoes, and  raincoat or umbrella for wet days.  A camera is awesome too.  Outside is beautiful if you're out for a stroll and keep your eyes away from your phone.

Ohh... "nag" =bag.. Sorry! 

*more editing*
There are are 2 groups of very hesitant people in the comments. The 'my city is too dangerous' group and the 'my area is too boring' group.  Please don't put yourselves in danger.  The areas you pick should obviously be relatively safe.  And I realize density of 'interesting' spots will vary.  The spots you pick don't need to stand out as interesting though.   Just spots you haven't really explored, other than mindlessly passing through.  
Here's what I'm getting at.  You may have walked down a street a bunch of times on your way to x, y, or z.   When you did that you were on a mission, and likely didn't take in your surroundings.   Go without a specific end point in mind, and with a sense of curiosity.   Curiosity is the key.

Here's how I picked spots.  Used Google maps on map view.  I looked for green areas, and zoomed in a bit to make sure they weren't private, then maybe switched to see if there were trees, or just fields, any water features, etc before deciding to add them.  Then I looked for yellow stretches along roads that denote commercial areas.  and added those.   Commercial areas are great, especially in quieter, or run down neighborhoods because you get mom 'n pop type places and never know what interesting things or people you might run into.   

*alright, another edit*
Lots of people are suggesting geocaching, or Pokemon Go.  Both are fun, and a great way to get off the  couch.  So is running, and strenuous hiking.  I think this is different because there is no specific thing to look for, or destination to reach.  We stroll to get a little air, and to give ourselves a chance to observe, interact with, and appreciate the details in our surroundings.   

  /n
/nBasically, just click the button from the time you get the phone through the final shot. People tend to appreciate candid shots and moments more than the staged ones. If nothing else, it gives them something to talk about later on. Of course... take the final one as well./nI have a coworker who routinely looks at online advertisements for free puppies, kittens, or bunnies. She will pretend to be getting the animal for her children, but will really take it home and feed it to her reticulated python. She admitted that she won't pay over 10$ to feed the snake. Charging a small adoption fee of $15 or $20 will deter her and other like minded individuals from dishonestly taking the animals for a food source. 

Note: I understand that snakes are animals too, and need to eat. I'm not bashing on snakes or snake owners. I merely take issue with the dishonest means by which this is happening. In some examples that she shared with me, the previous owners are calling and texting to check in on the animals, so she lies to them. If these people care enough to check up on the animal, they most likely would not have given the animals away if the true intent were known. Sketchy. 

Edit: Wow, this ended up being a really controversial topic. For the record, this is a true story. This woman is emotionally unstable, and quite frankly, doesn't have the mental agility to pull off a prank on this level as some have suggested. I do agree with many of you who have pointed out the possible warning signs of a sociopath, and I will definitely be reporting her. Thank you to all those who PM'd me resources and contact information. 

Also, I had never considered the concept of the bait dogs/fighting dogs and I found that to be enlightening as well.  As some have mentioned, the dog fighting rings may be the bigger more prominent threat. There were many comments that mentioned the fee really doesn't solve the problem, and that solid interviewing and vetting of new owners is a better strategy. I do not disagree. The argument of spaying/neutering pets was also made, and again, I do not disagree. The purpose of this post was not to spark ethical debate about the food chain, or which type of animals should be labeled "food" vs. "pets". Nor was the purpose of this post to vilify snakes or their responsible owners. This story would have read the same, even if the animal she owned was a Saltwater Crocodile. 

My goal in sharing this post was to raise awareness that there are sketchy people out there who are dishonest in their dealings, and who may not have your pet's best interest at heart. So, whether charging a fee, or conducting more extensive interviews, or spaying/neutering, we can all be a little more responsible with the animals we value, to make sure that they do not needlessly suffer. Hence the LPT.

Just give it a few shakes instead.

Also, cleaning a shaker bottle takes 30 seconds. Fill it up with hot water, add a little soap, shake it like a salt shaker. 

I use Kodiak Cakes mix, for anyone who is wondering. I think it's amazing, and it's also great for fried oreos. /nIt's probably for a personal reason, and may be because they're an alcoholic.

Make sure you renew it before you travel even if you have a few months before it expires.

Eg. If you are travelling to France and returning July 21st, your passport has to be valid until October 21st.

EDIT: Alot of people have been caught by this it seems. I spent the last 4 hours at the passport office and got an expedited passport approved and printed. Will be flying out this evening. This is an option for people who live near a passport office and can get your flight pushed a day or two. It says appointment only but if you get there early you can try your luck with the walk in appointment. YMMV

EDIT: Turns out my method of recording the screen is inefficient and ancient as fuck. Your recommendations are the shit, here's a compilation of what i saw+tried (will keep adding as they come in):

1. http://www.useloom.com/ -> This thing kicks ass, like how the fuck have i not known about this, you click a button and it records your screen, your camera and your mic so you can narrate what you're doing. Once you finish recording you INSTANTLY get a link to the already processed video to share. No waiting time. Seems like it lets you edit the video as well.

2. github.com/justinfrankel/licecap -> similar to the above, allows you to record a part of your screen in giphy. No audio/cam though. Great tool

3. https://www.teamviewer.us/ -> for realtime support, install it on your parents laptop and then whenever they have trouble just take control of their desktop remotely and do it for them. Brute force that shit

4. Have parents that understand tech -> apparently it's more effective than all of the rest combined/nIf you've ever had a vehicle stolen, you may not feel like you have any recourse. This isn't true. Go down to your local garbage company's truck yard at about 5am and hand out flyers to the drivers with information about your car. Offer $50 or a case of beer and chances are that we (garbagemen) will find it. We cover every street and alley several times per week and are generally pretty aware of our surroundings.

I had my stolen motorcycle recovered within a week, and another driver recovered a different stolen bike about a year later./nedit - RIP my post replies !! I'm glad everyone liked the LPT. I know some cashiers will give you a hard time about it but the majority of us really don't mind... and as people said. Do this at ALL retail stores!

Thank you kind stranger for making my day ❤️/nSomeone who is a good friend doesn't necessarily  translate to someone who has a strong work ethic. 


Recommending them only for them to mess up reflects badly on you and could ruin the friendship and your relationship with the employer. /nMy friends and I have had backgrounds that say “IF LOST CALL OR TEXT” + one or two of our phone numbers. It’s saved our asses more than once!/nA common scam people try to pull on the elderly is to call them and say something like "Hi Grandma, I'm stuck and I need money to get home."  often the victim will say "Oh is this Jake?  Where are you?" after hearing a name the scammer will assume that identity "Yes, this is Jake, my car broke down in another province and I need you to transfer me money to get it repaired so I can come home."  

The problem here is the victim asked who was on the other end of the phone.  When calling your grandparents, when they pick up the phone you say "Hi Grandma, it's Jake."  
That way they know that if one day someone calls asking for money, they not only know not to ask who it is by giving a name.  But they also know that if the person does say it's you that that couldn't be true because you always give your name when you call.


I started doing this with my grandmother after she told me she got a call one time just like the one I described above.  Someone called and said they were in jail and needed money for bail.  She said "Oh, is this Jake?" and the scammer said "Yes it is."  They insisted she didn't need  to come  to the police station but that they definitely needed the money.  She went to the bank to make the withdrawal and the excellent tellers realized it was a scam and stopped her.  
Since then I told her I would always give my name when I call and have been doing so for years.  
She had one other time someone called and she asked who was on the phone (asking for mine or my brothers name) and the scammer said it was me.  She realized that couldn't be right because I always say it's me after saying hello./nI've been doing this for a while now and the shelter is always so grateful to get more clothes. They are in need of winter jackets and shoes/boots the most this time of year as well./nA few months ago I started working for a coffee shop in a rich neighborhood.  A lot of customers get upset if they don't get their drink right away, and it doesn't help that we're often very busy.  I've found that switching "Sorry about the wait" with "Thank you for your patience" makes quite the difference.

"Sorry for the wait" is a very negative phrase.  "Sorry" implies that the listener has to deal with something unpleasant due to a fault of the speaker.  "Wait" implies frustration and impatience.

"Thank you for your patience," on the other hand, is much more positive.  "Thank you" is flattering to the customer.  People feel good when they're thanked.  "Patience" implies calm and understanding.  On top of this, it's easy to say with a smile.  People tend to not feel as comfortable getting upset at somebody who is smiling.  It's a lot harder to say a negative statement like "sorry for the wait" with a smile, as saying "sorry" means you are expressing sympathy or admitting fault.

Of course it's not going to work 100% of the time.  Some people are just irrational and impatient.  But I'd say a good 90% of the time when I use "thank you for your patience," the customer responds with "no problem" or "don't worry about it."

**EDIT**: Okay, so a few things to mention here.

A lot of people are saying "Thank you for your patience" is condescending.  Tone is a very important thing here.  If you say it in a tone like an elementary school teacher speaking to 10 year olds, then yes it is condescending.  When using this phrase, you have to use a tone that shows the customer that you genuinely are grateful that they have been patient.  And the key here is being genuine.  If you don't give a shit about their wait, then no matter how you say it it's going to come off as condescending.  If you genuinely appreciate that they are waiting, your tone is going to come off much more friendly and appreciative.  This LPT won't really work if you just use your generic "retail voice."

Some people are saying that the apology is better because you are taking responsibility for it.  The thing I've learned about retail is that if you take responsibility for every thing that goes wrong, you're going to have a miserable time.  If it is your own mistake, such as ringing in an order wrong, an apology usually won't hurt.  But there's no need for you to apologize if somebody else made the mistake, or if a customer came in with a large order, or if you can't do something due to company policy, or really for anything that happens outside of your control.  Saying "sorry" in those situations only makes you a target for the customer's anger.

People are inclined to mimic the behaviors of those around them.  If you act in a very positive manner with a smile and positive words, most people will act positively in return.  If you speak with many negative words, it makes it more likely that the person will react more negatively in return.  It's not going to work 100% of the time.  Play it by ear.  Some situations may work better if you apologize.  Some people would rather have their ego stroked with a "thank you," while other would rather hear you apologize.  But I've found in my experience working with a large number of customers every day, people tend to react more positively to "thank you for your patience" simply because it is a more positive sounding statement./nedit: than... mere verbal recollection. 

went to bed. Sorry, y'all! (east-coaster here)

... also to everyone mentioning photos. Yes, do this. 
I was rear-ended on my bike by an 87 year old man in a Buick, who said I "came out of nowhere," which to the world sounds like an ass-hole cyclist who swerved in front of a car. That wasn't the case. I had been waiting to turn left, so was in the left lane (which becomes a turn lane for a more prominent intersection up the road). I was waiting for a minute or two, waiting for oncoming traffic to cease when along he came, on his way home, driving in auto-pilot, neglecting to see a bike that isn't on his radar to notice. There were 6 witnesses who all said that I had been waiting, and was there long before he was. The one witness who saved my ass left a voice note on his phone detailing everything he witnessed, that I had been waiting. That he expected the car to stop, To swerve. I got unlucky. This witness was the only one who had a clear view of the incident, and in his voice note, you can hear the sirens from the ambulance and police. 

They thought I'd died, sent me to the hospital, and charged the old geezer with following too closely. 

I saw him in court, after everything was said and done, and he never once apologized.

Update: I get it, get a dash cam. I was hit while on a bike. I was rear-ended. The person who left the voice note was on a bike across the street. Sure, the driver should have had a dash cam. Tell him that./nI think everyone considers this but no one really does it. I personally can’t remember more than 5 or so numbers. Ironically, I thought of this while walking home from the gym, but I had left my phone at my apartment to charge so I couldn’t post this yet lol. Hope this helps

Edit: my very first silver!?! Thank you kind stranger!!!/nThink of how stingy you are with your money: if someone on the street asks for $10, you're not giving it to them. There's no way you're giving a 30% tip for a normal dining experience. And so on. 

And yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time. We throw it away, every day. I know I do unless I'm careful. What helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment, and to keep track of the returns I get for my investment. 

This approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment: a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments, for example, gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song. That's an incredible return. Other investments are more like low-interest, high security, long-term investments: going to the gym, eating right, etc. Some, like reading good books, are kind of a combination of both. 

But many activities are worthless from an investment perspective: whatever benefit they seem to give doesn't last any longer than the activity itself. Reddit is a great example: I can get super-invested in a Reddit conversation, but at the end, the second I shut down my computer, I've gained nothing in return. It gives me absolutely nothing of value. I've invested my time into junk. 

Edit: Some obvious things here. First of all, what's valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement. If you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want, then by all means, fill your boots. It doesn't build the life that I want, though - and yes, I'm aware that that seems hypocritical, but the fact is that I am highly aware that I'm procrastinating right now, and that I'll loathe my time spent on reddit when I lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight. 

EDIT: SORRY I CRITICIZED REDDIT OMG. But for real, maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than I am. You come for salient information, trenchant and high-minded interactions with others, and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner. Not I. Reddit is one of my boogeymen, so feel free to substitute your own time-waster.

Final edit: holy smokes, if I would have known this was going to blow up, I would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer. There's some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point I was trying to make. First of all, the examples that I used were all solitary pursuits, but that was just random - for instance, for myself, I don't think that there's a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends, or going on trips with friends and family. Those memories last a lifetime. Absolutely worth every second - and dollar. Secondly, I definitely don't want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste - that's the exact opposite of what I'm trying to say. Experiences, rather than material things, are what I've chased for most of my adult life. 

Really, this never should have blown up because it's not profound in the least. We all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness. All I was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment, and to question what return on it I'm getting. Investing my time in learning a new skill, being a good husband and father, making new memories with friends and family - those investments will yield a good life. Other investments won't - eating junk food late at night on Reddit, for example. And for me, yes, Reddit is a serious time sink - something that I'm trying to deal with. 

Lastly, I'd push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isn't wasted. Mostly, I agree, but sometimes, avoidance takes the form of enjoyment: if there's something that I know I need to do, and I watch Netflix instead, hell yeah I enjoy myself during that time. Doesn't mean that it wasn't a shitty investment of time, though. So, don't confuse avoidance/escapism with true enjoyment./nI took 40 of them to the local dog park. Not a single one left today when I went, which means some dogs had a good time!

EDIT: Yes, tennis balls can be bad for your dogs teeth. If you don't want to use them, fine. Those that do, it is indeed smart not to let them have free reign with them. But doesn't this go with everything we give our dogs? So use your own common sense and your own judgement and give your dog what you want. Just spoil the dogs, that's what is important. /nAs a professional in the event audio-visual/production industry, I cannot stress this enough. 90% of the time, the screen your presentation will project onto will be 16:9 format. The "standard" 4:3 screens are outdated and are on Death's door, if not already in Death's garbage can. TVs, mobile devices, theater screens - everything you view media content on is 16:9/widescreen. Avoid the black side bars you get with showing your laborious presentation that was built in 4:3. AV techs can stretch your content to fill the 16:9 screen, but if you have graphics or photos, your masterpiece will look like garbage. /nI'm sure this doesn't apply to every skilled hobbyist out there, but speaking for myself, and a lot of artists I've seen try to build successful businesses from their art, I can say that there is a good chance that you will hate what you do as much, if not more than whatever you're doing now for employment. Especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.

I've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while I build everything with passion and perfection that I take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* I often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when I'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. Before it was a profession I had great enjoyment for the process, but now I just can't help but count the minutes that I'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. The business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.

If you're going to turn your hobby into a business:

* Start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. Start slow and small.
* Manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week. 
* Never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. Be strict about this.
* Avoid "Commission Hell" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on.
* Charge appropriately. Don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. Don't charge more than your quality is worth. See what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically.
* Cramming will destroy your soul. If you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you WILL burn out very quickly. If you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish.
* Motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. You need *discipline.* If you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.

Enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. Keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.

Edit: Let me restate what I said at the top, since some people are dismissing the whole post. *This is a common occurrence with artists and hobbyists who take their passion and turn it to work*, it's **NOT THE RULE**. If you are doing what you love, wonderful. This doesn't always work for everyone though, and it's better to be prepared for something other than what you imagine going in or you might get in over your head and hate something you once loved. I'm not discouraging anyone from pursuing their passions, just the opposite, preserve your passions and pursue them with the right goals and mindset. Even the most fun activity is *work* when you have to do it 8 - 12 hours a day, so prepare yourself to *work.*/nI bring this up as someone who has been a Software Engineer for about 18 years now. I have been a "corporate whore" in the sense that I have jumped ship every 1-2 years in my career, except for one position where I was there for 4 years. 

Having been to a lot of corporations, it became apparent to me early on in my career that HR is more about protecting the corporation, and mitigating the risks of lawsuits as apposed to protecting the interests of the employee.

In leaked Target/Walmart videos that attempted to paint labor unions as horrible, they used phrases like "open door policy" (referring to an employee being able to discuss anything with a manager/employer, which would be removed if big bad labor unions got in the way), or "we are a family."

In no uncertain terms should you view your employer as family. In most cases you are an expense, and it really is a race to the bottom; how little can they do for you in return for you working for them and generating revenue/value.

A Job/Career is simply an agreement between what you think your value is, and what the corporation feels you are worth as an expense. The more confident you are in yourself, and the more you look for other opportunities, the better off you will be. 

Working extra hours above 40 hours a week, if you are salaried anyway, is something we all do/did, and its only when you are older and wiser that you realize that extra time is not worth the extra 1% bump in your salary. Shopping around for other companies can and do bump you 5-20% depending on role/responsibilities. Doing so constantly is the best way to maximize your income in the long run.

That being said, there are exceptions to the rule. The company I was at for 4 years contributed 50% match to my 401k, up to the federal limit. So if I put in 16k, they would match 8k, with a 4 year vesting period. Situations like that are useful for retirement. 

Before the 1970's, it was considered good practice to reinvest in your workforce, provide them with equity/pensions as a way to retain people. As automation/technological revolutions occurred, the value of each individual lessened. Additionally, during the 1970's, a new train of though started being taught in business schools that quarter over quarter profits for shareholders were more important than anything else. As a result, "trim the fat" became a mantra that future executives would hold dear, as well as be compensated against.

Had a good quarter? Awesome. Had a bad one? Perhaps we should replace you.

As an employee, your goal should be to gain as much as you can. Treat your employer with respect, but understand you are an expense. The days of loyalty are something corporations and HR love to talk about, but it seems to be a one way street. Don't settle for less than what you are worth. /nYou might discover some issues with drainage especially in the yard. /nGoodwills are more or less a reflection of where they are located, meaning buying from a Goodwill near you is like going to a local yard sale. Where as going elsewhere can be a treasure trove. 

Bonus LPT: The more expensive the area the more stuff you'll find; often people of certain wealth do not want to be seen shopping at Goodwill and will only drop items off.

Edit: Goodwill was meant to be interchangeable with thrift stores in general. Goodwill was just the one I picked.

Edit: From reading posts it appears Goodwill is not as benevolent as they seem. If you would like to donate, research how your Goodwill or other thrift stores deal with their donations and wear the money goes. 

Edit: Many communities may have distribution center in which the items brought in are spread to other locations. 

Edit: I know the LPT may not work for every store or location, however I am posting from experience and just wanted to share something I noticed. (My vote, look anyway it's a thrift store, you never know what you'll find. Plus the second LPT still has a chance to work as it means less competition.)

Thank you everyone for your comments (positive and negative) You guys are awesome!/nFor just about every Japanese language assignment, I wrote about a Seinfeld episode as if it happened to me.

I even did my cultural presentation on Festivus. 

These assignments are meant to practice your language skills, so veracity doesn't matter.

This tip applies to everyone, but the elderly seem especially vulnerable to predatory up-selling behavior. (In my area, cable TV+landline phone+internet are through the same company.) Go through the bill line by line and confirm that you know what a charge is and that it is something that is used. If you don't know what something is, call. If something isn't necessary, drop that service. Even if it is necessary, call and see if you can get it cheaper. They won't automatically drop the price for you unless you ask.

The neighbors gave it to me when knocked on the door (but didn't explain why they hadn't dropped it over to me in the previous 48 hours). I was thinking after that if they had signed they're address as the signature, i would have seen it and been to get the package without any hassle.

EDIT: this is the signature they provided as proof that my parcel was delivered

Or, when my wife was young, she liked shopping bags from high end retailers. Who knows why. Before long, she had massive amounts of them. Boxes and boxes of these pointless bags. Friends and family who lived in other parts of the country would send them to her. She got hundreds of them. Eventually, her enthusiasm started to wane. But the bags kept coming. It took a real effort on her part to get people to stop giving them to her. 

Not to mention you will end up with multiples of the same gift often.

I'm always happy to read your situation and offer my thoughts. I check this account a couple times a week, if not every day.**

Reddit tends to have a black & white view of cheating that I find naive. Crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating, but honestly I think they happen in even the most healthy relationships, and **as long as you both want to work through them, they are worth working through.**

My wife and I have dealt with crushes several times over our **10 years** together. Once for me, and twice for her. I swear, if I asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes, cuz it was shitty times, it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes, and that would have been the absolute worst advice. We've been married two years now (though we've been devoted to each other for ten years) and could not be happier. Each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger. So, I decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships. Obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy, but I don't think you should throw away a relationship. (Note: The crushes all happened before we were married).

#What are crushes?

Crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person (i.e. not their partner). This is different from people who seek out relationships via Tinder, etc. Usually they are with a coworker or classmate, because these are people they bump into a lot. They develop a friendship, and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly, they feel they "hit it off." They might feel the infatuation so strongly, it's like they are in love again. They probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much, how could they feel such strong emotions for another person? And for you, it must feel like a huge breach of trust. You gave them their heart, how could they?

I think it happens by accident, and it's normal, and it's hard as shit, but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it, you can. And your relationship will be that much stronger if you do.

#What are the right conditions for a crush to occur?

Crushes happen when there's a perfect storm of variables: **EDIT:** I got some feedback on this so I'd like to change it. ***Crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons, though I think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables:***

**1. The relationship is strained** Every relationship goes through hard times. There are ups, and there are downs, and crushes tend to happen when there are downs.

**2. You or your partner's life is strained outside the relationship.** Maybe money is tight. Maybe work is in overdrive. Family is sick. Life really sucks sometimes, and it can make us stressed, which can transfer into our relationship. We are more tense, and show our love less. We might still feel it, it's just harder to show because we're constantly stressed about other things.

**3. The partner is at work/school more than at home awake.** This one is pretty much all the time. We'll be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner. Then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home. Maybe they share an office, maybe they are in all the same classes. He's not trying to seek her out, they just happen to be in the same place most of the day/week. 

**4. The crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner** This might be kind of a cold way to think about it, but relationships can be thought of in terms of Pros & Cons. For example, my wife is not into sci-fi like I am, but this classmate did. We bonded over our favorite Star Trek series, and before I knew it I had a crush. In reality, my wife has a hundred more "pros" than this crush, but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con.

#So, your partner has a crush... What now?

Like I said, my wife and I have dealt with this several times over our relationship, and each time we've set ground rules, and each time we've come out stronger and more in love than before.

**1. Keep open and honest communication at all times, and work through it TOGETHER.** Don't hide your feelings from your partner, even if you want to protect the other person. You might not want to talk about it, wether you have the crush or they do, but you HAVE to communicate. You HAVE to know what your partner is going through at all times. *Work through it together, and you'll come out together.*

**2. Don't be alone with your crush** (like never meet up for coffee), because while she can't avoid working with him, she can avoid seeing him other outside of work. Meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level. You might want her to cut off ties to him entirely, but often that's next to impossible to implement. Think of this like a "soft" cutting off ties. Think about it, you have your "work friends," and then you have your "friends you hang out with." It puts a barrier there.

**3. Never complain or joke about your partner to your crush** Even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship.

**4. Spend more quality time together.** These crushes happen in part because we are at work/school more than we are awake at home. So, overcompensate a little. Turn off the TV, get off facebook & reddit, and play board games or go for walks. I always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner & drinks, because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship, but those can be fun, too.

**5. Don't give ultimatums!!** This is a very common tactic in these situations, and I think it only does harm to the relationship. It might seem like a good test of their devotion to you, but when you are emotional (which you definitely will be if you are going through this), please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum. More importantly, giving any ultimatum (however reasonable) tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship. Even more importantly, giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own, voiding the chance to work together, which is in violation of rule #1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve. It says to them, "I give up, it's your problem... fix it or it's over." My parents got married on an ultimatum, so believe me when I tell you it doesn't work the way you think it should. I'm glad they got married and all because I exist and all, but that shit never got resolved. 

#Giving an ultimatum ends the relationship, no matter what your partner chooses.

However, in the end, if your partner has a crush, maybe it's not worth it for you to work through their crush. It's a really hard process, and maybe you're not up to the challenge. Maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum. But let's be real, that's not because of *their crush*, or anything they did, it's because you don't value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough. And maybe you shouldn't value it, maybe it's a bad relationship and you should give it up, but just be honest about why you're giving up, (and don't give an ultimatum).

These above rules are really simple, and are relatively easy to implement. It's the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard. *Obviously, you need to set your own rules between you and your partner*, I'm just sharing what's worked for us. I hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations.

With the first crush, we set these ground rules together, and we've stuck to them, and they've all passed over. We were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place, and so our relationship is that much stronger.

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for the gold! I can't take all the credit, only half.

**EDIT 2:** Some people have mentioned polyamory as alternatives to my suggestions. Like I said before, these are ground rules we came up with together because it works for both of us, and neither of us are interested in polyamory. If that is something both you and your partner are interested in, you will need to set different ground rules, but other than that it's the same idea: Open & honest communication, deep respect for your partner, and not breaking the ground rules, whatever you set. The same goes for threesomes and open relationships.

**EDIT 3:** To those "alphas" calling me beta-as-fuck, that I'm emasculating/compromising myself, that I can't keep my woman in line, etc.... This is advice for a healthy relationship. Healthy relationships are built on open communication of feelings, and respect for your partner. If you feel like you should control your woman in order to keep her from looking at other men, then that is not a healthy relationship, it's a controlling one. And if someone is in a controlling relationship, chances are they are unhappy, and if they are unhappy, chances are they will be looking for another, healthier relationship. In effect, you are creating a situation that encourages cheating. 

And regarding me being "beta-as-fuck" I don't even consider that an insult. "Alphas," as I understand it, view women as objects to be controlled and used to meet the Alpha's own needs. If you want to insult me, call me an alpha (though that would be undeniably off base in the first place)/nAs a backup, after copying, paste into a text file... this happened to me years back in Windows 98 days on dial up...

Edit: wooooo front page /nThis will let you know exactly what you're getting. /nYou may panic and not say anything, then maybe hang up.  You aren't in trouble and you'll actually waste *more* of the operator's time by hanging up, because then they have to call you back to make sure there was no emergency.  

/nIf they're anything like me, they are really good at putting on a happy face and are not good at asking for help when they need it. This has been a really rough month and I realized today that I'm really good at hiding that fact. Someone just complimented me on always being so positive, though right now on the inside I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up, I really did not expect that. I sincerely appreciate everyone who responded, reading through these has eased my mind a bit. Also thank you kind stranger for my first reddit gold! 

To those of you who asked if I'm ok; Tbh not really but I will be. The darkness in my mind waxes and wanes and yesterday was a bit heavier than I'm used to, probably due to pain that's been keeping me from sleeping well the past month. I'm working on getting better at asking for help and expressing how I truly feel all the time, not just when I'm happy. I'd explain more of what I'm going through but I have a hard enough time doing that with friends, as this post has gotten much more attention than I was expecting I'll just say that I'm working on getting better one day at a time. 

Again thank you all, none of you are truly alone in this. Be kind to one another and yourselves. ~~Even~~  Especially the ones that seem mean spirited or grumpy, they often are just projecting and need it just a much.

I'm at work now so I'll try to respond to as many of you as I can this evening. Most likely through your inbox./nFirstly you should never pet a scared dog, especially if you don't know it.

My wife and I foster shelter dogs that are about to be euthanized and train them for CGC certification then adopt them into loving homes. One of the common problems we see are from a dog that was most likely previously abused is that it doesn't know if you are going to hit it or pet it. Petting/rubbing their chest is a submissive gesture that almost instantly conveys that you are not going to harm the dog and that you are indeed praising it. This works for two reasons. One you are forfeiting the high ground by using a non dominating approach and two that is an approach that most likely has never resulted in punishment/pain.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind words. I was honestly hesitant to post this because of how scrutinizing reddit can be. I hope this will be able to help someone and their pup.

I don't think this works on cats

All those asking questions I'll do my best to answer all of them that I can. /nTHEN you can go shower and not feel like you wasted a day :D

Actual real edit this time:

How the fuck do so many of you claim to not have ONE fucking day where you don't have anything planned that you MUST DO? Live a little for crying out loud. Doing nothing productive is good sometimes. And I mean, if you take so much pleasure in having your life sectioned into doing so many things on your days off, good for you, but don't bring your negativity unto people who enjoy the pleasure of looking at the fucking sky all day and think about nothing/nTL/DR: Can't get a corporation to do their job? Call their legal department and ask/tell them about their liability.

Story: The cable/internet provider's underground junction box on my corner had a broken latch, making the cover not sit correctly on the box. It's a big junction box, about 2'x4', and the kids who gather at the bus stop there were always playing with it and leaving it ajar. I wanted it fixed because (a) didn't want some kid getting hurt, and (b) eventually something would break and I'd lose my internet.

I called the customer service line several times and nothing got done.

So I called the corporate main number and asked for legal. Person asked how to direct my call and I told them I wanted to ask someone about their liability for injuries caused by their equipment.  Got a lawyer on the phone and told them about the situation, and that I was sure they would want to fix it ASAP because "if a child gets hurt there I'm sure you don't want that liability falling on you." Made sure to ask for their name, title, email address, and direct phone line and to mention that I would email my notes from our conversation to them, and would welcome any comments/corrections if I missed anything.

Cover was replaced within 90 minutes./nThe random act of giving flowers can mean so much more than when they're expected./nI've been practicing this by putting a candle up to our smoke alarm. Hopefully, I will never need to really use this./nThere's nothing worse than being a member of an 8 person social event and being stuck on one end of a row. You never get to speak with the people at the other end. Buying 4 seats in front of 4 seats for example, makes it easier for everyone to talk to each other.

Phrasing could've been better. Perhaps instead of "laid back" I should have written "wild" or something similar./nEdit: some brands come with tamper-evident packaging, either a cellophane ring around the lid or a film under the lid. **But many do not**, that natural seal formed by the ice cream hardening against the lid is what they rely on.

Edit 2: okay so to address a common comment here, no, the ice cream softening while being transported from truck to store case or from the store to your house won’t unstick the lid. Even slightly softened the ice cream stays “tacky” and adheres to the lid until it goes back in the freezer and firms up again. 

This form of packaging is just as “tamper evident” as a ring around the lid or a film under the lid. It does have a safety seal. The ice cream IS the seal. 

No, once you really pull lid off, you can’t stick it back on with your spit. It takes softened ice cream pressing right up against the lid then going in a special hardening freezer at about -30F to form the seal. Once you break it, it’s very hard to reproduce.

Edit 3: no, you don’t have to pull the lid off to check if it’s sealed. Just give it a slight tug, you’ll be able to tell it’s secure. If it actually comes off, it was never sealed to begin with./nE.g. If a friend gives you a ride home, I am sure you say 'thank you' as you leave the car. Before you go to bed that night send them a message telling them how much you appreciate what they did and how thankful you were for it.

Everytime you said 'thank you' to a friend, you should show them 'reflective appreciation' later.

EDIT UPDATE : Wooow. I had no idea this would get so many upvotes and comments. Despite the fact I missed out words and had several typos on my post I am glad to see that so many people have taken from it what I intended. 

A key phrase is 'catch them doing it right'. Let's be positive and show appreciation and love./nI saw [this meme](https://i.imgur.com/Q7EpWAf.png) circulating just now on facebook. As a medical professional, I realize there are a lot of misconceptions in the general public about medical care in the US. The first one this runs into: just because an ambulance is called for you doesn't mean you have to ride in it, except in very specific exceptions (for example, if you are a minor with obvious injury and no parent present, or if you are inebriated by drugs/alcohol). As a mentally competent adult, you have the legal right to refuse treatment and transport via an ambulance, so if you don't want to receive treatment or ride to the hospital (ambulance bills are expensive, especially out of network), just say so (competent medics will *always* strongly recommend that you do, because it opens us up to liability if we don't- it doesn't necessarily mean we think you need it). But we can't force you to come with us. Know your rights. 

If you state you do not want to be transported or treated (and you can refuse either or both, it's up to you), the medics will have you sign paperwork stating that you are refusing treatment or transport, and will usually have a witness sign it too. This form is for their protection, not yours, but it's a double edged sword: it can be used to prove that you did not receive treatment in the (unfortunately likely) event that the ambulance company tries to bill you anyway. Ask for a copy and if they can't give you one (usually they're on carbon paper, but not always) take a picture with your phone. This document is going to be your holy grail if they try to bill you erroneously- Having proof of it could save you thousands of dollars.

Buying something small at a convenience store and asking for cash back will often save you a few dollars. Bonus: A refreshing ice tea is your reward for saving money. /nMy life has been a disaster zone for a while. Everyday is a huge stress, which makes me a sort of expert in stress management. In times like that, even minor hiccups in your daily routine can derail your very fragile balance and sanity.  You may remember from your own experience how easily you can become unreasonably aggressive if you haven't been able to find something in your room for half an hour while being in a big hurry. Things like that, when thrown on top of the already present stress from a complicated life situation, can make you behave unreasonably and aggravate everything even more. Nobody knows how it's going to end, but you will unlikely benefit from it. 

Small things matter. That's where everything starts. The butterfly effect in action.

 /nEdit 1: since people are getting technical about things here. You can also use an appliance cart or air sled. I was just trying to give an easy tip that could be done with a screwdriver.

Edit 2: the side by side’s we’d sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. One of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. That door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. Then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. Removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. No, even with a standard dolly, I can’t move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. Plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately. 

Edit 3: I don’t know if this voids the warranty. I just installed and repaired the appliances. However, we’d do this to almost every new fridge we’d deliver. There was never a problem with the manufacturer and I don’t even know how they’d know it was done. I mean it’s just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. There wasn’t any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with. 

Edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door. 

Edit 5: all contractors out there. Can you not install those super tiny really high hard to reach cabinets over the fridge space. No one really uses them and the fridges are only getting taller. We would either have to rip them out or have the client buy a smaller model. /nEdit: I never thought I'd get to say this, but RIP inbox!!
This blew up way more than I could ever imagine, hopefully the advice helps

Edit2: Thanks for the Reddit Gold!/nEdit: obviously my grammar isn't that great by how i added an extra word in the beginning! You get the idea!/n[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/5m9zwd/i_got_a_job_interview/) inspired me to post this tip...

When applying for jobs, you **need** to give examples if you can; it's alright saying "I would do ..." but it's much better to say "I did ...".

Using this technique, I went from never hearing back from job applications to being inundated with replies and offers...Albeit "starter jobs" but you've got to start somewhere...

I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help.

Question: "How would you deal with conflict resolution?"

Answer:

Context: "Working as a front desk receptionist, I recall a time where a customer came in really aggressive and angry because his money was stopped"

Action: "I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so"

Result: "customer left happy, came back with the documents and was happy knowing his payment would be resumed". 

This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

Edit 2:

Wow this really blew up ...

I'm glad this has helped a few, and even got some the job...[At google no less!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4iwk8/?context=3)

I have been silently reading your comments, and there are loads of variants to these acronyms/phonemes(?) Whilst it [may not suit all](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4isb2/?context=3) it's quite interesting to see how vast it can mean in other applications. /nsimple.wikipedia.org/nEDIT: People keep asking for examples, here are a few that come to mind, but there are many, many more. I may add more as I think of them. Here are a few companies that have taken care of me outside of warranty for items over $100, and only one I asked for it for free (Chevy out-of-warranty repair). 

* Nordstrom: jeans that split in the seams after about a year they replaced no questions asked.

* Apple: replaced two iPhones over the course of 3-4 years outside of Apple Care that were malfunctioning after I broke the screen. Never asked for free phone. Went in for screen fix, they just replaced entire phone free.

* Apple: 2015 MacBook Pro having random issues. They thought it was the battery / fan assembly and charged me $220 to replace, but said it could be the logic board. If Logic Board, I would pay the difference ($550 minus $220). They even gave me a written quote. Found out after another month it was the Logic Board, but when I brought back in, they offered to replace the Logic board free for the inconvenience of bringing in a second time, and I never even suggested getting a discount on it or acted inconvenienced. Just being friendly with the staff.

* Kühl clothing: had a $250 puffy winter jacket, picked up a hot soup pan and melted it clean through. Composed a very funny email and picture documenting and sent to them and asked if I could pay to have it repaired since I’m such a klutz and melted it. Instead, they immediately sent me a brand new jacket. I didn’t even pay for shipping.

* Chevy: new-ish car at 40k miles or so. Needed expensive out-of-warranty repair after my car had already spent 3 weeks in the shop a few months earlier. I did ask for this one, because it was so close to the warranty period still and I wasn’t terribly happy with the reliability record of the car. They obliged.

* Rode microphones: Shockmount for a professional microphone broke. I called customer service to order a new one (3-4 year old product), and saw they were $50 on the website. Just told him it broke and I wanted to order a replacement part, instead they just offered to send a replacement free of charge. Didn’t even pay shipping.

* Verizon Wireless: broke screen on iPhone X, called customer service to see if I had the device protection (thought I did). Didn’t ask for anything free, just asked her if there were any options available, the rep said she’d gladly split the cost of the repair with me and promptly credited my account for $137.50 right on the same phone call.

* Blinds company (?): found receipt, limited warranty, I admitted having to pull them down hard to get them to close, possibly being responsible for the damage. I paid shipping to send them in, they repaired for free./nThis was something I learned during security training for a previous job I had. It's actually a thing. /nA trick I use for group photos is to loudly announce this before taking a photo and then use the example word "vagina" everyone laughs. click.


FP edit: holy shit! I made it to the front page! Send... ummm... money to charity.  water4.org is a good one. /nEdit: First, to everybody saying that this converts the file to an image - thanks, I didn’t know this! Second, if you’re asking why one would do this, sometimes you need to send one page of a document to someone and don’t want to go through the process of downloading, finding a website to extract a page, reuploading, processing, then redownloading. Or downloading a massive PDF splitting program so you can split your one file./nEven Mark Zuckerberg uses this LPT /nThere’s lots of holiday cards being sent through the mail this time of year. They are easy to spot since they’re usually a very distinct shape and size. Many times these cards will have checks or cash in them, making them really easy targets for mail theft. 

It’s clearly easy to track who cashed a stolen check, but not so much with cash. 

If your mail is arriving opened and things are missing, report it. There is a special postal inspection service specifically for this type of thing. You can report online or over the phone. 

[Here is the link to their site. ](https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/)  I called them today to report this exact issue and was routed to a real, live person very quickly AND they were courteous and very helpful. Took all pertinent information and confirmed it and let me know I would be contacted in the next 2-3 business days.  It was all very efficient and easy. 

Suggest to family members and people that might send cash in a card to, instead, send a check (since they’re easier to track, can do stop payments if necessary). If they must send cash, have them send in a standard sized security envelope (the kind that have some type of pattern on the inside to make them less transparent), or in a standard sized not security envelope, but wrapped in a piece of lined paper or two so it isn’t readily apparent what’s inside. 


**edit:** wow, this got popular! 
 
* Because there may be some confusion, reporting to your post office, is not the same as reporting to the postal inspector.

* I posted this because I have recently had my mail arrive deliberately opened.  And I mean, the envelope was sealed with packing tape that had been sliced through, presumably with a knife-like object.  

* I am in the US, but from the comments, it looks like the UK has something similar for their mail.  A quick Google search looked to have some good resources.

* There's a lot of folks saying nothing will happen, and that may be the case, but from reading the web site, it looks like they determine whether to investigate based on trends and number of reports.  If several people in a neighborhood are being affected, maybe try getting everyone to call in and report the issue so the inspectors don't write it off to "the mail machine probably tore up the envelope."

* If you can tell me how to get rid of the picture, I would be happy to.  When I added the link to the inspector's site, I guess Reddit decided to pick a picture of one of their most wanted.

/nA clean desktop and lack of games (you can remove them per user) can really limit distractions. Put a website blocker on the browser of the account for studying, this will prevent you even more from procrastinating.  

Taking this to the extreme: bonus points for everyone who dualboots Windows and Linux or uses VMs!

If you found the above too extreme, you can also try [multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/197625/how-to-use-virtual-desktops-in-windows-10/) as some of you have suggested.

**Edit:** This could also apply to a work environment, call it a presentation account.

**Edit 3:** Use *leechblock* to block websites on Firefox and *StayFocusd* on Chrome./nI used to work at Rockefeller Center in NYC and had to walk away from the tourist trap every day to eat good food at a reasonable price. Took that lesson with me to Rome, Italy. Instead of eating next the tourist spots (Palatine Hill, the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, etc), we'd always walk a few blocks away to where people stopped speaking English. Food was waaay better than the obviously frozen pasta we had our first day, before I realized what we should've been doing. 
 
Edit: As with any LPT, context matters.  In some countries, it's better and safer to stay within the tourist bubble./nPoor man's home security system. 

EDIT: Yes, guns work better. Not everyone can get them though.

EDIT2: It's true that no one cares about car alarms, but it will likely startle whoever is breaking in, and people generally hate loud car alarms.

/nOnce I learned this after being  a defensive person, it freed me from so much anxiety. I initiate the criticism, I take in the info and walk away. Now I hope this manger won't have an issue with coaching me in fear of being an excuse maker. And they will know I am open to growth . The latter part of my career went much better by doing this. 


**EDIT** To be clear a couple of key things. 

* This will not work with POS managers that are the worst to work with. They don't care, they will not be promoted and if they stick around with that company, it is an indictment of the company's over all culture and you should start looking for a better employer.

* If this type of behaviour is not in your repertoire **but** you really want to be a better employee, bring this up after your next review or privately that you are looking to change your ways. If it is not sincere don't waste everyone's time in my opinion.

You'll never use Calculus or Geometry, but statistics comes up all the time, and most people don't understand even basics like the difference between median and mean.  In business, a solid foundation in basic statistics comes in very handy quite often.  Most other math we're forced to learn in school, not so much. /nEdit 2: USE A BOWL OR A BUCKET...

*** It’s important to add that we soaked overnight only when very wilted(think wet paper) 

Like those in the comments, it’s best practice to do a short soak in a bowl of *cold* water for an hour & than place it in your crisper bin in the fridge.

Edit 1: This was in a produce-department ONLY sink, which was used purely for washing &amp; prep of vegetables. 

My apologies for some confusion, I wrote this in class/nEdit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger! I hope everyone gets a good night's sleep!/nI've done this with each of my dogs and it has worked wonderfully. It gives them a chance to audibly ask to go outside even when I'm not near the door. This in turn prevents scratching at the door (which can cause damage) and helps prevent accidents earlier on in life when potty training.

**Edit: Had requests about how to train this. Here's how:**

It's all about the treats and praise! What I do is I start by ringing the bell and giving a treat. I do this for a while until I notice the dog has associated the sound with receiving a treat (they'll lick lips or run over to the bell or something similar once they get it).

Then I'll ring the bell but make them go outside to get the treat (training them that bell rings, then you go outside, then you get a treat).

Then I'll take their paw or snout and physically make them touch the bell. Then we go outside and they get a treat. 

Eventually they'll connect the dots. Bell = outside. Treats can be withdrawn as outside is a reward in and of itself (running in the yard, peeing, chasing a squirrel, etc). 

It hasn't taken me long - just a couple days with even a few month old puppy. They learn fast!/nI get USA shoe size range from 9-10. But if I stick with my EUR size of 43, I never get the wrong size no matter the brand or type of shoe.  
  
Edit: precise is a better word than accurate.   
  
Also getting a lot of Nike exceptions. Don't own them so I haven't experienced that yet.   
  
But in my case and range of 10 different shoes companies and styles i.e. boots, running shoes, sneakers, skateboarding shoes. They are the same number. /nMac and Linux may require an unzip via terminal for some document types/nWhoa, this blew up while I was at work today. 

Yes, obviously it's OK to eventually express with the person that you understand their issue as you've been through something similar at one point (especially if you can sense that's what they're looking for). I really just meant that you should avoid making your story the focus of your initial response before you've acknowledged the other person's problem and have validated how they're feeling. /nPeople who are lost often begin to wander, and this strategy marks the first location you realized you were lost for both yourself and possible searchers. Title is a bit messy, but obviously terrain and environment will dictate the materials available to use for marking your location. Make your marking clear enough it will be able to withstand rain/weather, ideally for multiple days or even weeks. 

Once you have established your "home base", you may begin searching for the trail or other signs of human activity. It is incredibly important however to do this with a calm and collected mind, not panicking and trying to push yourself in a random direction in desperate hope. Begin slowly, and always count your steps. Mark your path away from your "home base" as you move, so that there is a clear way back. At first, only try say 20 steps in as straight as a line as you can manage, before returning to your home base. Now try a line in the opposite direction, 20 steps and return. This approach is much safer with a compass, as you can stick to cardinal directions and there is less chance of you becoming turned around. Always be marking your passage, and always try to return to your base as it is much more likely to be close to where people would be traveling or looking for you. /nBecause bed sheets and comforters tend to clog the airways for fans, laptop devices can overheat fairly quickly. By using a book as a barrier, you get more battery life from your device AND as an added bonus, you won't have to listen to your laptop pretend it's a plane preparing for taking off.  /nI just thought of this on a whim one day and have been doing it ever since. It's SO easy and works great.

(Note: by the time there's 10 minutes left, the water level should be below the "rice level" so the broccoli isn't gonna be submerged or anything, they just rest on top)

(Note^2 can also do this with quinoa if you're into that)/nI’ve put the health flair on this for mental health, hope that’s ok!/nEdit: Wow I totally did not expect this gain so much traction. 

Edit 2: Obviously it doesn't have to be a flower. The idea is to let your SO know they still matter to you outside of when you're expected to. It goes for both men and women as well. 

The idea boils down to something I've heard off and on over the years. Never stop dating your SO. 

Also forgive me for my comma mistake. I get it no need to punish me further :]. /nUsed to have a roommate who had multiple alarms and would forget to turn them off while getting ready for work. Just call their phone and the alarm will shut off once you hang up/nI did this for when I started guitar and helped a lot./nEDIT: Yikes, so many mixed opinions on here. Guess I rustled some jimmies with this one!
EDIT2: Why is this gaining so much traction? Lol./nI myself get carried away in Hallmark holidays and forget that mother's day and Father's day isn't always a positive experience for people. 

Reachout to those who may not be celebrating due to their relationship with their parents/ loss of parents , as the day can be pretty lonely, even a small text goes a long way./nEdit: Whoa FP!!! So many people to thank! 

I definitely want to address some of the most popular comments:

A lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.

Also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. My vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but I will definitely be taking this into consideration. 

Kong balls/bones work best as they are very difficult for your dog to destroy. 

TL;DR: might be best to give to dogs outside; onions are bad and in broth; Kong Balls are where it’s at!/nThought of this because  I recently found a recording of my grandpa telling me one of his stories from when he was a cop. Watching my grandma's reaction when she was able to hear his voice again years later... Everyone needs to do this for their family. You never know when something might happen, but especially older people and sick people need to do this. 

And I know people have mentioned saving voice mails before, but having a story or a personalized message is so much better than a random voice message. People don't think about when they are going to die, and not everyone may think to save a voice message from you. Do this for your loved ones. Put it on a flash drive and label it, make sure it is somewhere your family can find it. Your loved ones will greatly appreciate it./nThe advantage of downloading a sample ballot ahead of time is that you can avoid a lot of confusion when confronted with ballot initiatives, judges, or whateve else you may not have been expecting to see and haven't researched how to vote.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people would agree that the idea of speaking in front of large groups of people can be terrifying, and so we tend to avoid it whenever possible. There are times, however, when we are faced with the task and there's no running away: we must say a few words. The following is a template for success which you can use when it's your turn to speak, in just about any type of gathering, formal or informal. 


**1. The Greeting**

*"Good..."*

The greeting is the easy part. You begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time of day it is. ***Good** evening everybody...*

**2. State the Event**

*"As we all know..."*

The second part is also very easy: You simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is, and what you're all doing there. ***As we all know,** we're here to celebrate the marriage of John and Kate, and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together...* Now you've got the ball rolling, and the words are coming out easily. You look like you know what you're doing up there, and people are listening. So now, it's time to....

**3. Establish Common Ground**

*"We've all..."*

It's important to include your audience as part of the message you're delivering. Talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration. ***We've all** had the wonderful opportunity to get to know John and Kate and enjoy watching their love develop...*

**4. State Why You're Speaking**

*"I..."*

Include a personal account, or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking. What gives you the right to be speaking..? ***I've** personally been very lucky to have John as a close friend of mine, and it's been quite amazing to watch how he's grown as a person, and couldn't be more pleased for him to have found someone like Kate to go about his life with...* 

**5. Call for Action**

*"So let's all..."*

Finally, close your speech with a call for action. This lets everybody know that you're finished without you having to awkwardly say "That's it!" or "I'm finished, thank you"...that is how every weak speech is concluded and makes the audience uncomfortable. You should say something like ***"So let's all** raise a glass to John and Kate, and wish them well. Cheers!" or, **So Let's all** give a big round of applause to Mark for the outstanding job he's done while working with the company"* 


Obviously, there are many different ways these leading lines can be used, but if you can commit them to memory and be prepared to use them next time you might be asked to speak, you will let go of all fear and anxiety, and people will be SO impressed with your ability to get up and give a confident, fluent speech in front of a group of people, while looking like you didn't even have to prepare! Good luck, and happy public speaking!/nThis has saved me a few times... If your bags become lost it is very easy to simply show the baggage claims representative a picture of your luggage on your phone rather than try to describe it, *especially* when there is a language barrier.

Edit: My first post to Reddit and it somehow made it to the front page! Thanks all! 
/nI did this to our main bedroom years ago, and have installed them in other bathrooms since then.  In many cases, it's as easy as replacing the light switch.  Of course, this doesn't work with fluorescent bulbs, and I'm not at all sure of the state of the technology with respect to LEDs.

Edit: This earned gold!?!?  No kidding!  For a quickie post I did 4 months ago?  I love this place.  Thanks, kind stranger./nDon't be like me.
 
 
 
 
Source: Got my bike stolen, saw it online, can do nothing about it/n[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027711000345)/nI know a lot of people don't know much about this but you can get into almost all museums for only one dollar. The prices that are displayed in the museum and on their website are all suggestion donations in which they want you to pay but aren't required to get in. The process is just as easy as well. Simply go on the same line that everyone else goes on to get in and when they ask you for your payment, give them a whopping one dollar and bam you're in. I'm posting this because I recently heard a number of classmates that wanted to go but simply didn't have the money for the suggestion prices. Please spread this to all friends and family that might ever want to go to these museums in the future.

**Edit:** Damn did not expect this to blow up as big as it did, so thank you everyone who commented and voted on this post. First of all I want to state that I am a high school student that doesn't have a job so obviously this is something that is very convenient to many students and I. If you have the money to pay the suggested donation then I would recommend you at least pay a little more but that is totally up to you. 
Okay, clarification on everything else, firstly this only applies to public museums such as the MOMA and the American Museum of Natural History. Private museums however make you pay whatever their admission is. I see some things in the comments saying that some private museums allow free access on certain days of the week but I am not a hundred percent sure that is accurate so I would recommend doing more research on that if that is something you are interested in. Secondly, this applies to various public museums within many other states and countries and is not only a thing that occurs in NYC as many people have stated below which I found to be very convenient to people that do not often come to NYC. Thanks again everyone for all the feedback and have fun at any museum you do plan on visiting in the future.

**Edit 2:** A word and a space.

**Edit 3:** Thank you for the gold kind stranger!

**Edit 4:** Thank you for the gold king stranger number 2!/nIve been investigating residential burglaries for over 10 years. Myself and every other cop I know does NOT pay for a burglar alarm monitoring service. Why you ask? Because most burglars are in and out in under 5 minutes. The alarm company has to call the house, then after they dont get an answer, they call the police. Then the dispatch center has to get the details, set up the call, and dispatch an officer. The quickest I have ever seen this process is about 8-10 minutes from the door being breached to an officer on scene. 

If you want to make your house more secure, you can do a few things that burglars notice. a very large dog bowl at the front and back doors gets noticed, even if you dont have a dog. Also burglars avoid detection at all costs. Very obvious camera placement is a very good deterrent. Also wifi doorbells that have two way communication work well. There are many more, but alarm monitoring is a waste of money. 

Edit*** Since people have asked me what is a good set up for home security without paying a monthly fee....I am a big fan of smart home technology....I specifically go with smartthings. I can trigger lights based on motion sensors, I have wifi enabled cameras that I can access on my smartphone that can trigger lights and alert my phone. I still have an alarm system in my home, I just dont pay to have it monitored. Everything I listed does not have a monthly fee. Basically I am the monitoring service for my home, and im much quicker than a dispatcher calling another dispatcher. 
****edit 2***well I leave for a few hours and come back to the front page and gold, thank you random guilders...seems like people are interested in these kinds of tips from an actual law enforcement officer, I'll try and think of some more. Also yes I'm aware of the "a" and "an" rule, it was a typo lol/nKids are shorter and can often see spots that as grown ups we cannot.  Walking on your knees or or crawling might make you find whatever they decided to hide easier./nBy summarising what they are trying to say, it will either reassure them that you do understand or it will highlight exactly where the miss understanding is.


EDIT: well this certainly blew up! 

Reading some of the comments, it's clear that a lot of people aren't quite understanding where I'm coming from. Basically what I'm saying is that when people feel like you're not understanding them, some people may repeat themselves. If you summarise what they are saying, it will hopefully reassure them that you understand, if not, at least you'll know which part you don't understand. :p/nThe days really start to fly by when you're working full time and you're going to have fewer and fewer opportunities to see your buddies from school or college as the number of responsibilities you have increase. Its a real bummer when you clear part of your weekend to see someone and they flake out on you. People remember that./nI've experienced it too many times that I find out someone genuinely respects me and looks up to me when they're introducing me to someone else. I've caught myself doing this to other people I think highly of as well.

All it takes is one sentence, but it can change everything for that person (or just make their day). It's really not that hard. Do it!/nI've never known a dog to shy away from licking someone's face.

After watching someone chase their dog around for 20 minutes(the dog thinking it was a game) I walked over and layed down. The dog immediately came over to lick my face and I grabbed its collar./nAnd even if you lose your watch, the serial numbers are still in the warranty paper. 
Most serial numbers have a combination of letters and numerals.

Edit: If you have multiple passwords secured on a third party software/website, you can set the master password to the watch serial number./nJust make sure the sock doesn't have holes.

You can also stretch the sock and secure it with a rubber band./nEdit: This is in reference to an alarm on your roommate's PHONE. No, calling a phone will not turn off your alarm clock. (Thanks to the many, many people who pointed this out). 

I mentioned this in a long-buried comment, but I've only used this with my roommate's iPhone on iOS 10. Some people say this doesn't work on other phones, so please go ahead and try it out, I hope it helps you! 

Also, this is for either extremely lazy people, like myself (I am someone who uses chrome Remote Desktop for my computer 6 feet away and I have both my TV and LED light strip remotes command-strip velcroed to the wall next to my bed), or for anyone whose roommate has left their phone in a private/locked room. 

Interestingly, some people have suggested flipping the electric breaker on and off real quick to reset any alarm CLOCKS left on in locked rooms while the owners are away. (As always, the real LPT is in the comments!)/nMost people are aware of this, and while I still dislike the smell of most of these foods, they taste delicious to me now. Don't just smell and dismiss them.

/nWith California fires spreading, if you have time, take a video/photos of your possession. This will make any insurance claims much easier to process. /nSomeone mentioned car dealerships doing this in another thread, and I didn't even think about it when it happened to me. I went home and looked at the original contract and the contract they had me re-sign and noticed several differences that I didn't notice before because my payment was the same and, due to our friendly conversation, I was admittedly distracted, trusted him, and didn't read the new contract because my payment was exactly the same. 

What the dealership had done was originally financed my car through the dealership for a lower interest rate, then changed a lot of the finance numbers to ensure that everything matched for me in the short term (i.e. my monthly payment) but my interest rate jumped three percent, I assume the commission for the salesman had jumped, and they sold my contract to another finance company. The numbers inside the contract including the final sale price of the car, the trade in of my car, additional warranty for mechanical issues, the gap coverage, and other miscellaneous dealership fees had changed dramatically to suit the needs of the finance contract to ensure that they could get the financing. I'm now getting the paperwork from the finance company to ensure that what the dealership sent them matches what they gave me.

TL:DR - Don't sign anything without reading everything first, and get all changes in writing which highlights all changes before signing a new contract from any dealership.

Edited to remove an assumption on commission.

Edit 2 for clarification - The dealership informed me during the first signing that I was approved through one finance company and had me sign the contract, and idiotically (my fault admittedly, while letting the guy talk to me through the signing and not paying attention to what I was reading,) what I was actually signing was financing through the dealership. The "error" was that in the 12 days between the first and second signing, they had actually sold my contract from their dealership to the finance company that I was already approved for (or that they had informed me I was approved through.) So, the second contract was the exact same form as the first, but the interest rate, many of the numbers were different, as well as the finance company had changed from the dealership to the finance company they had already informed me I was approved through./nI'm paying the price of this mistake 1 year after buying my first car.

I basically have to buy a new car with the very little money I have and I probably won't get a penny for my own car unless I lie just like the asshole who sold me the car did to me.

Edit: I know the head gasket wouldn't trip the check engine light, but the fact that my o2 sensor and catalytic converter need to be fixed and my CEL has never once turned on tells me that he tampered with it in some way.  Whether he ripped out the bulb or painted it or whatever, the fucking light doesn't light up.

EDIT: Thanks for the support guys <3 /nI've spent nearly 20 years repairing liquid/water damaged electronics. More specifically, cell phones. In the old days, we'd open the phones up, clean the corrosion, resolder, etc. Recently, they've (the manufacturers) moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements, swap outs (FRU = factory replacement units) & insurance. Now if you want your electronics repaired locally, you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporate-ran store.

I know rice is the go-to recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics, and it works, to an extent. It will **passively** absorb moisture. Unfortunately, you don't want to passively absorb the moisture, you want to *actively* **remove** the moisture as quickly as possible.  The longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards, the higher the risk of corrosion. And corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours. If the damage isn't severe, we'd take contact cleaner (essentially 92% or better rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage, the quicker it will evaporate) and scrub the white or green powder (the corrosion that formed) with a toothbrush to remove it. If that corrosion crosses contacts, it can cause the electronics to act up, fail or short out. The liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics, it's the corrosion that takes place after the fact (or the liquid damaging the battery, a new battery fixes this issue obviously). 

Every time I see someone recommend rice I kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter, it really doesn't do much to prevent the corrosion that's going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever. 

What you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow. Take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it (remove the battery, etc) so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible. Even if it's not in direct contact with the air, the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside. It's just a small amount but it's significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture. True, rice can act as a desiccant, but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster. 

I personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely, and put those items in front of a fan, and if you have the relevant knowledge, I highly recommend doing so as well. But if you don't, it's not that big of an issue. What you want to avoid at all costs, however, is **heat**. Do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer, heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid, sometimes more so. Heat, extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics & cell phones. A fan (lots of airflow) is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice. I would say 100 out of 100 but I'm sure there's going to be some crazy situation or exception I haven't thought of that someone will come in and point out. I'd like to remind people that exceptions are just that, they don't invalidate the rule. /nMany times a more enthusiastic or extroverted conversationalist will attempt to hijack a story to have the moment of glory, but discourage this behavior by continuing to engage the original speaker instead of turning your attention to the hijacker.

3. HELP WITH THE DAMN DISHES!/nThis tip comes from a friend of mine who is into growing a certain kind of recreational plant. 
I usually did it the other way around, taking the big ones first to make space for the small ones. Turns out the other way around is much better.
The big leafs are basically the main power source of the plant. Taking all of them weakings the plan and it will slow down the growth. 
Takingthe small ones will declutter the plant and make space for more small leafs. 
(This just applies to a heavllily used plant, not a fresh one where all leaves are big) 

Edit: 
As many pointed out, this is not ment to be a tip for growing weed. 

Additionally I have to add, it's true, if the big leaves take all sun from the small ones, take some of them out as well. This tip is ment for already harvested basil plants, with some big leaves and a lot of small ones coming. Like many I always thought, the big ones are "ready" and make space for the small ones. In this situation rather take some small ones than big ones, and help the plant grow back faster.

I think I've stumbled into some kind of suppressed Jimmy Fallon hatred./n7-11 stores have their own subs, fruit and some other food that have a sell-by date, and when it reaches midnight on that date, they are required to throw it away. The food is still good though, and you can ask the clerk after 12 if they have anything that they're throwing away that night that you can take to the homeless. The stores in my area always have a bunch of stuff they're throwing away, and they're not allowed to take it home but if you're on duty and explain what it's for then they usually are more than happy to. I usually wait untill around 1 a.m. so they've had a chance to gather all their throwaways and mark them off.

And on the cold nights, they usually will let you grab a tray of hot chocolates to pass out as well.

Turkey thaws at a rate of 3-4 lbs a day (edit: thaw in the fridge, bottom shelf, on a cookie sheet), so a 21 lb bird needs to start thawing now to be ready for Thanksgiving. Note- drips from the turkey can contaminate food below.

Other turkey tips: 

* Don't stuff a bird for best results. Stuffing stops the air in the cavity from cooking the bird and makes it so the outside must be overcooked to get the inside to a safe temperature.  

* A safer alternative to stuffing that still enhances its flavor: butterfly the turkey and cook it on a bed of stuffing.  This will reduce cooking time, look at a few recipes to get a feel for how long it takes.

* If you have to thaw a turkey quickly, keeping it in cold running water for a few hours will work. However, this method take more work, can add another unknown time element if done the day of, wastes water, and I don't think the end results are a good as a slow thaw.  

* Avoid recipes that cook at 350°F or higher for the duration. I cook my 18-22lb bird at 250°F for about 3 hours, then go up 400°F for about an hour. (Edit: apparently Alton Brown's method starts high, then goes low, so there are other ways)

* Use a probe meat thermometer to tell if the turkey is done. White meat should be be 165°F (maximum, after resting, the bird will continue to cook, so pull it ~10°F earlier) ~~and dark meat 180°F.~~. Apparently 170-175 for dark meat is recommended by Cook's Illustrated.

* While there are minor differences between brands, almost all frozen turkeys are the same. I always get the cheaper store brands. The only real differences are between Kosher/organic/seasoned.
* (edit) Don't baste or open the door to peek- it's more important to maintain a constant temperature. With a higher temp near the end, the bird will brown very nicely.

http://i.imgur.com/lBovZZE.png/nThis is in no way acting as a discouragement! I've spent the last 10 years in some sort of animal rehabilitation and shelter volunteering, and it breaks my heart to see how often animals get returned after a few days because "he's just not adjusting."

In many cases, the animals I've personally worked with have been rescued from abuse, malnourished, or strays. Volunteers work very hard and have several guidelines as to what makes and animal ready for adoption. The top 5 complaints I've seen in my experience are:

**My new dog keeps going to the bathroom in the house**: First thing to consider in this situation is, *where was the animal living while at the shelter?* some shelters may keep their animals in runs or cells and often these animals don't get walked. That creates a habit of the animal being used to using the bathroom inside. Proactive walking really helps correct this problem! Take your dog out often in the first few weeks and then start to dial it back gradually. 

**Our kitty was so friendly and playful at the shelter, now she just hides all day, I don't think that we're "connecting"**: Your kitty was so happy and playful because she was somewhere she was accustomed to. Imagine, you may have shared a room with a friend, had a set schedule. All of a sudden you were taken, probably put in a cardboard box (also DONT LEAVE CATS IN CARDBOARD CARRIERS!! Cats are sensitive to over heating and it could have life threatening implications. Bring your own well ventilated carrier when adopting) went for a scary ride and were dumped out into a strange environment **alone** and away from everyone you knew. Give kitty time, she'll get into a rhythm with you. The best thing you can do right now is provide a clean litter box, fresh water and proper feeding at set times. DONT DRAG KITTY OUT FROM UNDER THE BED, this only enforces the need to find a better spot to hide.

**New Fido does nothing but bark non-stop all day**: FIRST OFF, this complaint usually comes from apartment dwellers. If you're adopting a dog make sure **beforehand** that your lease allows pets. Don't just get a dog then when your land lord shows up to say you have to get rid of it claim that it's a service dog/your just watching it for a friend. Fido is alone! Fido used to be in a place where there was a lot of commotion and all this silence is *weird!* HOOMAN WHERE DID YOU GO?? Dogs are pack animals, and when they're alone they feel vulnerable. Long walks and playtime before you have to leave for an extended period of time are good remedies to this. Leave a TV on on a low volume to shield all the scary outside noises. In my personal experience crate training was a great tool, but don't get one too big or too small (big enough to stand up without ducking the head, and and turn around in). This method was recommended to me by my vet and just happened to work, but it may not work for you. Professional consultation about a dogs excessive barking habits is never a bad idea. All relationships take work!

**Why does my new pet act so lethargic? They were so full of energy when we first met! It's what I liked about her!**: What are you feeding her? Is it the same food she was eating at the shelter? Sudden changes in diet can trigger upset tummies and more negative consequences. Food changes should be done gradually, consult your vet on the best way to do this if they start showing signs of stomach upset. It also has to do with the stress of being in a new environment, all these knew sights and smells are exhausting to process!

**Our new pet doesn't get along with our existing ones**: This. One. Is. huge. How would you feel if your s/o, roommate brought home some guy named chad and was like "oh yea, chad lives here now." Dogs (even though they're pack animals), and cats can be very territorial. This behavior may have only shown up when you caught kitty- hair standing on end making those *hilarious* guttural meowing noises; kitty doesn't understand that this new kitten is "pet of the family now" and not the evil outdoor neighbor cat. Even though you're in the same household, introductions should be done gradually. Giving each animal an opportunity to sniff and item that has the others scent on it, allowing them to sniff though doors etc. if your bringing a new dog home to your existing dogs, consider taking them to a dog park or anywhere fenced in that's not your house. This gives them the chance to interact and also escape each other if they feel really threatened, and it's not on territory that your dog may be trying to defend. Make sure interactions are positive, this doesn't mean that they get along every time- but that the animals get praise for not being aggressive.

Hope this helps some people navigate the first few days of shelter pet adoption!  And P.S. There's probably a bunch of typos. 

Edit 1: thank you u/E32636, u/bluesoul, and anonymous user for the gold!

Edit 2: I mentioned a few times in here about my kitter constantly peeing in the house. We took him to the vet and found out he had a UTI and was prescribed a prescription diet. Also something to consider when thinking about getting a new pet! What you think is a behavioral problem might actually be a medical problem! 

Edit 3: Sorry to all the other "Chads" I may have offended! Lol/nEDIT: Thanks for the upvotes, pals! I did want to clarify the part about "never" sending an email when you're extremely happy. 

If you're responding to an email about someone's amazing news about winning the lottery/buying a house/getting engaged etc. it probably makes sense to write them back with a message full of passion and emotion. I was thinking more in professional setting or in situations involving money or some kind of transaction. Sometimes when we're really happy, we agree to do things we wouldn't normally do and we get taken advantage of.

I feel most people already know it's a bad idea to send an email when you're super pissed about something, and that you should wait until you calm down. But fewer people (including myself, until recently) don't realize it might be a good idea to wait until you've calmed down from being in an extremely joyous/excited state before sending that email./nWe do this, and it’s made birthdays so much better! They get to give something that seems fancy (even though the difference between top shelf and supermarket brand can be like $10 max), and we get something we’ll actually love using. /nEspecially if you are corresponding with national wedding chains, such as The Knot or David's Bridal, your email inbox will be spammed with multiple emails per day once you start using their services. This LPT has the additional benefit of keeping all your wedding planning emails in one place./nHaving recently done a lot of experimenting with "upgrading" cheap frozen pizzas to make them taste less, well, cheap and frozen, this has been by far the most important trick. 

Commercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to 700- 1000 degrees, which is why they bake so quickly and end up with nice crispy crusts and un-burned everything else. Your home oven will never get that hot but you can try to get as close as possible to emulate the effect. 

Cook the pizza on the bare rack to maximize air circulation if you don't have a pizza stone or a cast iron skillet/slab. If you have either of those, heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature. 

For even better pizza, brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it. (The garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza). 

Edit: Forgot to mention, keep a close eye on the pizza if you're going to do this! 5-8 minutes is a pretty general number and, depending on the temperature your oven maxes out at, your pizza could go from "perfect" to "burned to a crisp" in the span of a minute./nMost bags have an upward liability limit of around $3500 per ticketed customer so you can get reimbursed for items bought above $500 but you have to deal with the claims dept. in the airline. It is much easier to just take the $500, all most airline reps will do is verify that they saw a receipt and mark the case as settled for $xxx.xx amount.

Separate pro tip: if you ever have any issues, like any issues at all, on a flight, stop by the airline office and just say that you had xyz difficulties and that you normally enjoy flying with said airline and is there anything they can do to make the next trip better.

He said it works about 1 out of 10 times, which is still better than the odds when there is 50-100 cards in the bowl. Someone actually came up to him after the drawling and said, "you must be lucky, you always get selected." My father shot me a wink./nThis is a piece of advice my dad gave me over the weekend and I'd like to share it with you. 

He has been working for a company for well over ten years. This is a large commercial real estate company and he manages a local property for them. He has been there over 10 years, and for the first few there were plans to develop the property into a large commercial shopping center. Those plans fell through and now the property owner is trying to attract an even larger client for the entire property. 

However this attraction process is taking its dear sweet time. They keep telling him "six more months, six more months..." - that was about three years ago. Now the day to day drudgery is catching up to him and he's not happy. He recently interviewed for a position that would pay him almost triple his salary and would reinvigorate his love for his career. 

So, the LPT is...don't wait. Don't keep telling yourself six more months. If you have an opportunity, take it. If you can create an opportunity, create it. 

Grab life by the horns and shake!

edit2: I'm being smashed by engineers saying this is a bad idea because "read comments below" please note: I'm talking about holding together small, mostly cosmetic bits and pieces of play equipment. Not load bearing, structural things. Many people have mentioned zinc plated and galvanised nuts and bolts as an alternative to stainless steel. If you are concerned then seek professional advice.

My communication has been, for the past 2 days, primarily texting my family or whispering. 

I noticed that people have "tuned in" more when I've mustered up the energy to either whisper, or text.  One of my chief complaints was that people don't seem to listen to me (in order to obtain what I want to say), but take away the frequency, and suddenly, people are interested. 

Also, for my own "personal growth" aspect, it's helped me to learn to think about whether what I want to say is really worth it, and has taught me an important life lesson.

People struggling to come up with things to be grateful for: read the top comment below. I just thought it was an awesome answer. :)/nThis is easy and very rewarding.  Nature is everywhere, yet unfortunately humans tend to clutter it with garbage, damaging the ecosystem to the detriment of all of us.  It's a big problem, but we can all help.

Find a local area, beach, river, forest area, whatever, go there, and pick up some trash.  Simply put a plastic grocery bag in your pocket before heading out and spend a nice couple hours in nature making it a healthier, happier place.

Benefits:
Spend time in nature, helping to conserve, preserve, and restore.  (Don't forget to check out all the little life forms you are benefiting by helping to clean up their home)

Get a bit of exercise.

Make the world a cleaner, better place.

Who knows, maybe somebody will see you cleaning up and it will spark a train of thought that eventually leads to them helping to clean up too someday.

Instead of waiting for other people to change, to stop littering, we can make a difference today.  And it feels great doing it./nI'm always surprised to see men not initiating handshakes with professional women as they would with other men.  I've made a conscious decision to do it with everybody regardless of sex.  It's interesting that some of the women actually acknowledged it - so it must not just be me.

Edit.  Thanks for the upvotes.   I wanted to note that some have commented that it may not be the same in all cultures so know your circumstance.  
Edit 2:  apparently the person of higher authority should initiate a handshake.  I never really knew this and think it's kind of silly.  But be aware.
Edit 3:  It's interesting to see so many different points of view in the responses.   I'm speaking primarily about US Business.   Be aware of the cultural and religious implications before initiating handshakes in other countries.

Thanks for the upvotes./nPeople feel more valued or in control if they get to make choices about the task ahead. I learned from taking care of my nephew that if I ask him "What do you want for lunch?" It can turn into an endless thing about why I don't have his favourite food or why we can't go to McDonalds. Instead I say "Do you want pasta or toasted sandwiches for lunch?" He makes a choice and feels some measure of control even though I have maintained control over what I have to make.


This can be manipulative but if you're managing a team of people with a lot less experience than you it can be tempting to map out every aspect of how they do a job. Some jobs are highly complex and time-sensitive and have to be done a certain way. Wherever possible find areas where people working under you can make choices or use initiative safely. They are more likely to take pride in what they're doing and take ownership of the task if they have some measure of input.



EDIT: Some commenters seem to be missing the 'even if' in the title. I'm not saying manipulate people all the time. Where possible, give them genuine scope for initiative and genuine choices. If necessary, and without being too obvious about it, manufacture choices. People work well with structure. Too much and you're micro-managing. Too little and you're giving up control. Good managers should avoid these two extremes./nStory time: yesterday I found a ticket on my car's windshield. It was from a private parking enforcement company and my car was parked on the street. I knew I was legally parked, and I also happen to be a former employee of this company and know that they don't check street parking (the city does). I checked the plate number on the ticket, and it was for a different car - same color and type as mine, but different manufacturer.

This is actually the second time something like this has happened to me. The first time was when I was working for this parking enforcement company. One of the perks was that when I was off-duty I'd be able to park in company-run lots without paying and if I got ticketed, I'd just turn it over to my boss to void at the end of the week. One day I got a ticket for a car that wasn't mine and pointed it out to my boss, thinking that the lot-checker that day must really suck at his job. My boss says "I know what this is" and explains to me that sometimes people will try to get out of paying a ticket by leaving it on the windshield of another car, hoping that the other driver will pay it without noticing it wasn't for them. He said "This is one ticket I won't be voiding - let's let them have fun with our collections department." What killed me the most about that one was that the car it was for was a brand new BMW convertible, and I was driving a 20-year-old Mazda that showed all the signs of having been the car that two siblings and I had first learned to drive in. In the absence of any other evidence, I'm forced to assume the BMW belonged to Donald Trump.

TL;DR: there are dickheads out there who will try to trick you into paying their parking ticket for them by leaving it on your windshield, so make sure to check the plate number on the ticket before paying it off./nEdit: want to highlight my encouragement to learn this as an extra tool for persuasiveness. Not the only tool, nor one that works in every situation, especially if used poorly. Just as sure as you can hammer a nail with a wrench, you can ask a question that is argumentative and contradicting.

On a side note, this is my first post on Reddit and I am humbled by the number of up-votes. Thanks!/nEdit: I was not referring to politics or religion when I wrote this. Also, there's a difference between someone who is misinformed and someone who has a different opinion to you. Just because two people have different views on something; doesn't necessarily mean that either of them is wrong. 

Also I just wanted to clear up that I'm not American, I'm from England so pls stop confronting me about Trump/Trump supporters as I don't know an awful lot about American politics. /nIn this case, "overloaded" is synonymous with "deadlines will be missed".  "Overloaded" does not mean "I'm extra stressed this week". So with that being said...

Telling your boss you are overloaded can bring with it negative connotations such as: you are bad at prioritizing, bad at time management, or just slow.  In other words, their first reaction is likely to be that you're just complaining and not stating a fact. 

A more tactful way is to do as I said above.  Create a list of all your major tasks and prioritize them. Then go to your manager and ask them to verify the priorities as you have outlined without saying that you are overloaded.

This lets them see on paper that you have a lot on your plate. This also lets them know you are thinking ahead and that you are practicing prioritization skills. This also lets them take some responsibility for when you miss a deadline on a task because you BOTH agreed it was a lower priority. In doing this, you avoid the questions and criticism for missing a deadline. Plus, your manager now serves as a first line defense. They will be ready to defend you because they know why you missed a deadline and they were part of the process that led to that happening.

I speak from experience. A year ago this burned me. I missed a deadline because I never conveyed how taking on a new higher priority task forced me to postpone work on another major project. When the deadline came, hell rained down on me because I did not convey to my superiors that I had to keep pushing my project out to work on higher priority items. They were blindsided when I missed my deadline and I was blindsided by how disappointed they were with me.

The real LPT here is: as your priorities change, make sure your boss knows how that impacts your other tasks and the deadlines associated with them. 

Update: I didn't expect this to resonate like it did! I'm glad it's a useful LPT to so many. To clarify, I'm most certainly not advocating you abuse this. As with anything, this is a useful tool when used smartly. And obviously this is under the assumption your manager is at least decent at what they do and care about their subordinates./nIf you make a mistake huge or small, you should almost immediately try to let your boss know what happened and your side of the story. Do not wait until someone snitches on you or a customer confronts your boss.

Always cover yourself as fast as you can.
/nI work at a music venue, and have for a long time. My hearing isn't near as good as it used to be, and the tinnitus is just a reminder that I need to make sure I use earplugs. Spend the money on some good ones. Your ears will thank you.

**Edit:** well, who knew this was going to blow up?  :). RIP to my inbox for sure.

A few things about myself: I'm 44 years old, and have been working in and around music since I was 8. My tinnitus started in high school band. I was a tuba player, and being around all the brass instruments definitely played a part in it. Also I was playing in a punk band, and neither activities did I use ear protection. I've been living with tinnitus for over 25 years, although for the last 15 or so, I've coddled my ears, because I'm afraid to do any more damage to them. The ringing is constant, and sometimes, even with noise in the background, the ringing is so loud I can't focus. It's horrible, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

It doesn't take much. Sustained noise at 85db is enough to cause damage. Heavy traffic is often louder than this.

You *do not* want to be deaf. Protect your ears.

EDIT: To all those saying to simply check the mirror, remember that mirrors are usually only available those in the front seats (and often only the driver's seat), while this trick works for ANY seat in the car. 

Another benefit of this method over 'just look behind you' or 'check your mirrors' is that it ingrains the process of checking for cyclists/cars/whatever into the process of physically leaving the car, making it much harder to forget. /nSo much of our self destructive criticism derives from the very immature and incorrect mindset that to be great at something means to not use a framework, or some form of correction. Freehand work, and one take work is entertaining, but true progress is the product of tenacity and a thoughtful work plan./nIf you're like me, you have boxes or albums full of old photos and quite a few stored digitally. These pictures are just as precious (if not more so) to the people in them as they are to you. You wouldn't want them to go the rest of their lives without seeing them, would you?

This can be a daunting project, if you have a ton of photos, but it's very rewarding too. You can instantly make your friends' and family's faces light up as they see your photos and remember "the old days."

What you'll get in return is hearing old stories you've forgotten about (or never knew) and the appreciation of the people you've photographed over the years.

I hosted a party once and excused myself for a moment to dig up a couple old photos I had of two of the attendees. One of them brought his girlfriend and I showed it to her first. She had never seen a picture of her boyfriend that was more than a few years old. They were both elated.

I would suggest doing this privately (as opposed to randomly posting it on their Facebook wall, for example). Let them decide if it belongs on social media in order to avoid any potential embarrassment.

EDIT: Obviously, there will be some situations where this isn't appropriate. Always keep other people's feelings in mind in this and other situations. (Bonus LPT for ya.)

EDIT 2: Front page, thanks for the gold, RIP inbox. etc. Also, [cat tax](http://i.imgur.com/zDnPKOM.jpg)./nI loaned my skinny tie out... came back with a quarter on the inside of the bottom. Frickin' genius.

Obviously does not apply to ties with all seams stitched closed.

EDIT: I see a lot of people saying, "just use a tie clip". I don't like tie clips, myself. So I am offering this as an alternative.

**RE-EDIT**: I asked the person whom I thought I loaned the tie to. Turns out he never borrowed that tie. The only thing that could have made this happen was: when I moved, I had loose change in a dresser and some ties in a separate drawer. In the move the change must have worked its way down to the tie drawer and *by an act of god*, this LPT has been brought to you./nAfter all of the people who give that same day, the local banks will likely have enough for a WHILE. But blood only has a "shelf life" of about 40 days. 

Often people will see that so many people gave recently and will not give a week or two from now. This means that, after the shootings today, on July 22 or so Orlando blood banks will likely hit a huge low point. 

If you haven't given today, wait until next week and give. Or the week after. If you have given, give again in eight weeks. 

EDIT: Last sentence have/haven't. 

EDIT 2: Changed "three weeks" to "eight weeks" before you donate again per messages some of you have sent.

EDIT 3: At /u/J0my's suggestion: Even if you're not in the area where the event happened give anyhow, it can help an overall blood shortage problem. Also, you *might* want to make extra sure you give this time since a large portion of the community targeted cannot give blood./ncredit to /u/rambantu.

Chances are they will try turn around to ask you a question if you're teaching them, and many times they don't think about the gun in their hands. Plus you can better see what they're doing and coach them appropriately. 

This is also true for archery. There have been several occasions in which someone has tried turning towards me with the string pulled back, which is a situation many times more dangerous than a gun

Edit: with all the traction this post is gaining, I should add that this is not a substitute for teaching basic gun safety, but it ensures that you, the acting instructor, remain safe if the shooter has a lapse in focus which is more common than you'd think/nAny time my girlfriend mentions something that she loves or we share a new consumable she really likes, it goes into an Evernote note.

Each item in the list is grouped by type (alcohol, clothing brand+size, chocolates, etc.), and each item is a link to a Google Image Search so I can easily spot it when shopping.
Let's say I am passing by the wine store on the way home. With one search I can pull up her favourite red wine or prosecco, with a link to what the packaging looks like.

This might come off as cheating a little, but your S.O. appreciates the time and care you take to make sure you remember, not the inhuman ability remember things without electronic help./nJust found this out, it's pretty cool and useful.

EDIT 2: Only tested on Windows, I'm not sure if this works on Linux or Mac./nIf you use the phrase "I assumed...", you'll be viewed as having hastily jumped to a conclusion based on insufficient evidence.

If you use the phrase "My understanding was...", people will merely think you misunderstood something, and will be far kinder to you (and in instances where what you misunderstood was something they said, they will often apologize, or fault themselves for not being more explicit).

This is especially useful in a professional/workplace environment. Telling your supervisor you "assumed" something typically results in a reprimand; saying "My understanding was..." will instead be attributed to a miscommunication, or a lack of clarity in their original instructions.

Edit: Its also worth pointing out if you're using windows 8 / 10 you can get the netflix app which not only supports 1080p but also 5.1 surround sound!

Edit2: Loads of people asking about all different setups, so here's what people have generally been saying:

Xbox one, PS4 and the native windows app will support aunt to 1080p and also support 5.1 surround sound.

Microsoft Edge will do 1080p.

No browsers will do surround sound.

The cause is apparently Netflix DRM based and therefore won't affect other services unless they do the same.

Apparently "Chrome on ChromeOS does not have this limitation and will do 1080p."/nMost arguments in a relationship are trivial and mean nothing - both people know that it has no effect on your overall feelings for each other, it's just an small falling-out.  There is no need to tell your friends about every little detail as they might grow resentful of your spouse from hearing everything bad that you tell them; making awkward situations when you're around both./nPeople who are habitually late or cancel plans always have excuses that are usually dishonest, and the recipient knows it. Having these excuses makes the late person feel better about themselves. 

If you forbid yourself from making excuses, you will make an extra effort to show up or be on time because it is really awkward to just take the blame when you disrespect someone else's time.

Obviously, major events don't count. But if you really just felt like watching the rest of a show and that's why you are late, don't blame traffic. Just apologize. It will increase the value in your mind of being on time./nKeep a small tote with a few essentials in it in the trunk of my car for emergencies.

I keep:

An extra set of clothes (socks, shorts, cheap flipflops, sweatpants, shirt, sweatshirt, underwear, and a hat)

Insulated leather gloves

Flashlight (batteries not inside to prevent draining/corrosion)

Deoderant

Towel

Hand sanitizer

A deck of cards

Lighter

Small cheap pocket knife

Paracord

I can't even tell you how many times this has been a total lifesaver for me or others. Went hiking and your socks are soaked? put on some dry ones. Go on a road trip and forgot deoderant? Boom, no problem. Went fishing and someone fell in the water? They have dry clothes and you are their hero. 

The tote will be shockingly useful in a lot of surprising ways, too. One time someone hit my car, knocking my bumper half off. Luckily I had rope to tie it up and get it home. Another time I was drinking at a friends' and we all decided to go swimming. I got the gym shorts out of my car and didn't have to go swimming in my jeans/naked. I also had a towel to dry off with.

My tote is pretty small (14x10x10 or so) but has had a solution of most of the problems i've ran into. Everything is pretty cheap and well worth the time to put it together. Does anyone else do anything similar or keep other things in their trunk? (A small first aid kit is also great to have, but I keep that separately)

edit: Easier to read formatting

edit edit: Wow I can't believe the response! A couple of things from the comments: A lot of people have mentioned melting deoderant. Granted, I live in a colder climate (northern Michigan) but the Old Spice Pure Sport I have has been in my trunk for years and hasn't shown any sign of melting. Water is also a great thing to have, but be aware that in colder climates it might freeze! Water and deoderant are both items to have, but definitely tweak your list of supplies for whatever climate you live in./nIt works for pretty much anything from IT to cooking to menial tasks with a knack to them. It forces you to logically think about what you are doing and helps reinforce your own knowledge./nI realized that I have lots of ideas for things I should do, and I have a tendency to mention these to friends and family.

Someone recently commented that I never finish anything, and while I do have a procrastination problem with some things (like decorating my home), I realized that a lot of this perception is from me saying a lot of things that I may not have been serious about, but mentioned.  So when they see me *not* doing it, it makes it seem like I never finish anything when in reality I probably didn't even start.

By telling people when you've done something, it gives the appearance that you get stuff done and make progress.

It can be a hard habit to break if you love sharing your "what if" ideas, but by not doing it, you'll craft a better image for yourself./nI work in guardianship, and it is often my job to step in and see that elderly people have their needs taken care of when they no longer have family who are able or willing to take care of them. One thing that I see constantly in my line of work is elderly people sitting down in a wheelchair and never getting back up. Sometimes this happens for reasons out of our control, like the person is a fall risk or has fallen and broken something and needs to recover and doesn't get the proper Physical Therapy that they need. Other times it is more avoidable; the elderly person simply has no one to accompany them on a walk, spends all day sitting in their chair, and eventually loses the strength to be able to walk by themselves. 

Watching someone go from walking to being in a wheelchair all of the time usually results in one thing: their overall health rapidly diminishes. For example I have one gentleman who refused physical therapy and refused to walk after an injury. This gentleman went from being a spry 50 year old to looking like he was 80 years old in a matter of six months. It is also not uncommon to see people sit down in a wheelchair for good, and ultimately go to hospice within a year. 

If you have somebody that you love that is aging, encourage them to walk if they can, take them places even if it's a burden, walk with them, hire a companion to walk with them, encourage your family to help them stay active. In my experience there is one thing that people who make it into their seventies and eighties and beyond have in common, and that is that they keep moving.

Edit: Thanks for the gold!  Elder affairs are something I'm really passionate about, so if anyone else wants to give, find your local Public Guardianship office and make a donation!  These offices are state funded and often rely on grants, and they work to assure that people that are unable to make decisions for themselves, mostly elderly people, are well taken care of and get the services they need. 

If that's too much work, there's always [Meals on Wheels](https://www.mowaa.org/donate), who do an extremely incredible service for elderly people all over the US!

Edit 2:  Just wanted to point out, because I'm seeing a lot of this:  Elderly people can be a fall risk, and a fall could dramatically alter their health at an older age.  Don't take people who cannot walk well out for a walk.  Some time on a recumbent bike on the lowest setting, heck, even sitting in the chair and raising and lowering their legs could help immensely as a start.  **If you have a loved one who needs help getting back on their feet, look for physical therapists to work with them, don't try to do it yourself if you are untrained.**
/nBy getting there early

-you won't be overwhelmed by 20 people, only a few are usually there early.

-you will have more time to introduce yourself to the host(and close friends) and make a lasting impression

-you will be able to greet people as they come in and have a better chance to talk to everybody. 

-Newcomers who get there later might see you as someone already on the inside of the group and this will raise your stock and give you more opportunity

-if you can drink, you will have time to talk to people before they get drunk and have more chances to be remembered once again 

-it will also give you more flexibility as to when to leave, you can stay late or leave early. 

-in the end, you will enjoy the experience much more if you get there early.

Memorize short, contentless transition phrases so you can say them on autopilot between slides and use that time to calm the initial panic.  You'll be able to collect your thoughts and sound more comfortable and confident when speaking about the slide content.

The wine we got delivered was terrible. They delivered in the summer  (reputable wine clubs usually have a freeze period on deliveries during hot months to ensure your wine isn't ruined during shipment) and didn't mark that there needed to be a 21 or older signature upon delivery.

If someone is a fan or experienced with some type of product, they will know more about it than you. Don't give a professional chef a knife. Whatever he/she has on their kitchen is probably much nicer and more expensive  than anything a layperson of that field would buy. If you know someone who frequents wine tastings and has a collection of wine, they probably have at least one (if not several) wine membeships. The gesture to get someone something they would love is wonderful, but the actual gifts fall short. 

If choosing to go this route this way, ask the gift receiver or someone close to them their preferences or do some snooping to see what they already have. There are experts out there to help find something comparable! 

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! See me later on TIFU by telling all of reddit my sister's gift last year sucked. 
Honestly, my sister is very thoughtful and I am very hard to buy for. She had the best of intentions and I did appreciate the sentiment.

Half of the work in selling a car is to get the buyer to come to the dealership.

**Wow, my first gilded post! Thanks mysterious person. Hope this proved useful for you!**

A few years back (I've no idea how long ago, to be honest) I discovered in some computer magazine that there exists these hidden tricks within Google to get the best out of their search engine and have been pretty much doing it ever since then.

This will be a somewhat long post, I imagine, but only because there's a lot there.

The various things I'll be covering will be Boolean searches - [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) goes into it in greater detail than I will be, as I'll be keeping this as basic as possible (and as basic as I know it!) and various other tricks.

**Boolean searches**

As mentioned earlier, I'm really not going to go into this in a huge amount of detail, especially regarding what is going on behind the scenes, because I genuinely don't know that.

For Google searches, the ones I'd use the most are OR and NOT (AND was included in this, but now I believe that Google recognizes any space as an AND function). **These always need to be entered in all caps, otherwise Google doesn't recognize them as operators**

**OR** would be used when you want to search for multiple variations on something, essentially, and brings back all the searches it finds. Imagine you're looking for motorbikes from all over, but you know they're referred to motorbikes and motorcycles in different places. An example of a search you'd use would be

>motorbike OR motorcycle

This will return all the pages it finds that used either the word motorbike or motorcycle within their text. *I believe that you can also use the character |, making it motorbike|motorcycle, but I think both works equally as well?*

**NOT** is how you would get rid of search results that you know aren't at all useful to you. I would usually use the minus sign (**-**) as opposed to writing NOT. I would usually place this at the end of my search string, but I'm not 100% sure if it matters. *I'm sure someone will confirm if this is the case*

To continue the example from earlier; you're searching for a motorbike, but for whatever reason, it keeps bringing up results for some knock-off brand, we'll make one up and call it Kavasaci. You absolutely don't want this at all, so your search string would look like this:

> motorbike OR motorcycle -Kavasaci 

Make sure there's no space between the minus sign and the word you want to remove. This will remove *all* the search results that mention this particular brand.

Boolean searches are more or less covered now, so I'll move on to other tips and tricks - I'll be ignoring the motorcycle example from earlier and using ones people might actually use frequently.

**site:**

We all know that many sites have an absolutely awful internal search engine, which is either basic as hell, is too confusing to figure out, or just doesn't work whatsoever. You can combat this by using site:, followed by the URL of the site you want to search for, without the www. I'll give some small examples below, but it is only really limited to the amount of websites that are searchable through Google.

>site:reddit.com

>site:reddit.com/r/lifeprotips

>site:linkedin.com

What this is pretty much doing is telling Google to search this very specific website, ignoring every other site.

**" "**

Quotation marks are extremely useful in Google searches, because it tells the search engine to search for the exact word order and phrase within them.

As mentioned earlier, Google recognizes a space as AND (which will return any site that mentions all of the keywords within it). Let's take this example: You're trying to look for a song that you heard on the radio, but you only gleamed maybe one line and the DJ refuses to name the song. If you were to type the lyric into Google like this

>mama just killed a man

It might return a load of results that happened to contain all of these words - maybe a sentence like 

>mama just went to the shop. Back then I would have killed for a cup of tea. I saw someone coming towards me and I realized it was a man

To combat this, you'd use quotation marks around the exact phrase you know that you want to find:

>"mama just killed a man"

This has been a very basic view on how to use Google. A lot of these can be applied to most search engines. To give one last practical example, **lets say you're looking for a new job**, whose description lists your skills, using LinkedIn's search engine. We'll use OR, "", NOT. This will be an example to show looking for specific skills and other keywords that would be useful.

You might look for - 

>HTML OR JavaScript OR PHP media OR internet OR "online media" OR "digital media" -internship -trainee

You might notice above that there is a space between PHP and media. This is taking advantage of the fact that the search engines recognize the space as AND. It is being told that you'd like it to return all results that mention *any* of the keywords from HTML to PHP but *also* any that mention from media to digital media. This can be useful for finding very specific jobs. 

It will also get rid of any results that will mention internship and trainee.

And there we have it. A very basic view on how to use Google and other search engines, to find very specific things when it is required.

A lot of this has been gleaned from the people over at [Boolean Black Belt](http://booleanblackbelt.com/), which while geared towards sourcing talent/recruiting, can be very useful for learning new tricks.

If you have any questions, let me know. I'm sure someone will tell me I misunderstood some concepts and I'll most certainly update this if that's the case.

Edit: Fixed typo. 

Glad so many are finding this useful. There's some extra tips in the comments section that I absolutely recommend people to read. /nThrow a few of those silica packets in your toolbox.

Keep everything that got a grade until at least the end of the semester. Professors aren't perfect, they do lose things and when they do your grade suffers unless you have proof. 

Just today, I check out my grades at the end of the semester and see that two of my homework grades were missing. Send the professor an email explaing that I did them and he tells me "oh well." I look through my book bag and find both of them. Saved myself from getting a failing homework grade. 

TL;DR Save your graded work. At the end of the semester you will thank yourself.

Edit: Didn't realize how many people don't keep graded work while at school. Nonetheless, helped me pop my front page cherry./n---

(Note: Every video should automatically play in HTML5 format, however, the occasional video may slip through and play as Flash, that is why I provided the tip to make an individual video HTML5!)

i.e.

**HTML5**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeOjFno6Do/html5

####FUN FACTS ABOUT HTML5 ON YOUTUBE!

- You can playback the video in 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x and 2x speed!

- **Some users may experience an issue where you can't always get full HD videos; depending on the browsers.

- Videos load more efficiently and will keep loading until the end! You can also go to any point in the video without having to wait for the video to reload! (Videos will load slower in the background to make room for other bandwidth activities, such as games, streaming, ect)

- Going into fullscreen automatically sets the video to 720p! When minimized, it reverts back to what ever the previous resolution was WITHOUT having to reload it! (Meaning you can have an entire video loaded in 360p (or 240), go to fullscreen in 720p (it will have to load) and when you click out of fullscreen, the original 360p will continue playing without the need to reload the rest of the video! Also works if you are in fullscreen and select the previous resolution, that will play the fully loaded version in fullscreen without having to wait again!) --

- Works with embedded videos on other non-youtube sites automatically! :D --

- General use for both Flash and HTML5, press **M** to mute the audio!

- The "Snake Game" easter egg does not work in HTML5.

- With both Flash and HTML5, press **J** to rewind 10 seconds, **K** to pause/play, and **L** to skip ahead 10 seconds.

- Press the left/right arrow keys to skim across the video by a few seconds dependant on the key direction.

Your first impression will be significantly better if you nail this introduction - and if you have a canned speech prepared for this scenario you will be amazed at how confident you come across. 




**EDIT:** The consensus seems to be 3-4 minutes is way too long - aim for 30 seconds or so. 

My reasoning behind "preparing" a 3-4 minute long introduction is I can use the entirety of the prepared speech if I have to give a presentation, or I could pick and choose the relevant parts for when I meet people./nBy toxic friend I mean someone who you regard as your friend, but doesn't do anything friends are supposed to. I knew a guy I thought was my best friend, and we were at first. But towards the end of the friendship he was acting like he was better than me.

This made me feel I wasn't good enough and was lucky enough to have him as a 'best friend'. It really destroyed my confidence. 

In reality, I deserved better than that and I eventually decided enough was enough and completely cut him off. I didn't speak to him for about the year we had left at school together, and oh my God what a difference it has made. My life is 10x better than before, when we were 'friends'.

This might seem like a petty childish thing, but a friendship like that is really damaging to your mental health. If you have a toxic friend, for the love of God get rid of them. You do not deserve to be treated like shit by anyone./nhttp://i.imgur.com/xETLKcZ.jpg

Edit3: Thank you for the gold, /u/Lkira1992/nSometimes (all the time) when I connect to my office wifi network or a public hotspot I end up failing to retrieve the login page for one reason or another. Sometimes my browser's auto-redirect tries to hit the internet for instruction on how to handle the new network and fail miserably.

By browsing to "192.168.1.1" I just about always get redirected to the network's login page. Since I'm not trying to hit something outside the network the redirect happens inmediately. Then I'm free to look at all the porn I need to!

Note that if you go to 192.168.1.1 and it brings you to an insecure router control panel you probably don't want to be on that public network.

I've tested this technique and it works well for me. Regardless, you do you and enjoy your bread!/n97% of the time, a non-talkative person is already aware that they are quiet. We already know. In fact, most of the time we are already straining our social muscles to the limit just to not appear indifferent or rude. 

A lot of people think that pointing it out and statements such as "Why are you so quiet?" is an easy joke/tease to break the ice, but it just puts us on the spot. There really isn't a great follow-up answer to say.

And it is just annoying.

Instead, if you really want to help to get someone talking more, simply direct a question to them that would be easy to answer and allow them to naturally enter the flow of the conversation. 
It is especially great to do this when in a group.

Edit: The point is simply that the fact that an individual is quiet does not have to be said out loud. I did NOT mean that introverts shouldn't make an effort to talk if they want to be included or that extroverts should just ignore them./nWhen you remember that time you soaked a sweatshirt in perfume because you were lending it to a cute boy, fear not! Try and think of a humiliating moment that happened to one of the people watching you.

I have many such cringe-worthy moments in my past and when I start to curl up in shame, I remember that I'm probably the only one who ever thinks about it.

Edit: Wanted to leave this edit-free for a while. To address those saying "This is bullshit, I remember the shit they did" or "Look at this reddit post where people talk about stuff they remember," note that a) I said probably, and b) you really think all those people lie in bed at night thinking about your embarrassing moments? All right then./nDoing a research project with three other students for a professor and two grad students. Literally did all the work. 100% of it. Not even sure if they logged onto the shared document once. And it's for a research conference next spring, not just a class project or something. 

I'm emailing it to the grad students and professor tomorrow. How would I go about indicating that I was the only one who even touched the project? Is there a way to do so without sounding annoying? I just want them to know how much care I put into this project and maybe indicate that these other two are not great to work with for future posters/publications.

Any tips are welcome! Especially from grad students or profs.

Edit 1: Stop asking me why I waited until the project was over to bring this up. The project's not over. This is just the second time this has happened and we've only had two components to the project so far. That's why I'm asking for advice now and not in like three weeks.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the advice! I've emailed my co-contributors asking for specific help in specific areas. If I don't get a response, I'll bring it up with my prof. If I do, that's great. I'll be a better communicator going forward on this project while continuing to work my ass off. Thanks everyone!

Edit 3: Y'all, I'm a girl, as is my lab professor. It's interesting how many people are referring to us as men. Not offended, obviously no one could know that and I might have done the same thing, but it's just interesting.

Some benefits include:

-If you have to rent a different place for whatever reason (has happened to me 3 times now due to job change and an iffy landlord situation), you don't have to worry about changing your billing address, or contact other institutions which have your address on file. You're less likely to lose important mail between moves.

-If you're living with roommates, you don't have to worry about them snooping through your mail

-Having a secure place to receive your mail may reduce your chances of being a victim of identity theft. You can go out of town for several days and your mail is still safely locked at the post office.

-It might give you some comfort knowing that your physical address isn't on file with a bunch of organizations or businesses (there are some limitations to this where you HAVE to give someone your physical address, not a mailing address)

-Psycho relatives who want to send Christmas cards don't have to know where you actually live. Hooray!

If you're deciding which post office to get a box in, but aren't sure exactly what part of the metro area you'll be in long-term, aim for a more centralized location near mass transit.

Getting a PO box might cost you $50 a year, but it's very worth it IMO. 

**Edited to add:** I had no idea I'd get such a big response to this LPT! A couple thoughts based on the comments here:

As several folks have pointed out, it's probably a better idea to get a UPS box, especially if you buy a lot of stuff online. I don't, and I feel like my PO box has suited me well.

If you do decide to get a PO box, it'll be the most worth it if the following conditions exist:

1. You get a relatively low volume of mail (meaning you don't have to check your box often)

2. You end up moving frequently within the same metro area

3. The cost to rent the PO Box is reasonable (some cities may be as low as $50, others will be as high as $150)

Also as someone pointed out, check the USPS website for lobby hours when you're deciding where to get your PO box./nMany cats are outdoor cats, so a kind stranger will probably not call you if they find your cat outside. But if you make it clear that it is supposed to be inside, this can greatly increase your chances of being reunited with your furbaby!

Edit: A lot of people are bringing up the Orange Collar Project. This is a FANTASTIC idea and great to use in conjunction with the tag concept. The idea is that if your indoor cat breaks out, it is a kitty convict that needs to be returned home! I have looked for orange collars in pet stores, and they are pretty hard to find. Here is a [link](https://www.amazon.com/Kitty-Convict-Cat-ID-Collars/dp/B018IRQ316) to some Kitty Convict collars ($14) for anyone interested./nBlocked toilets are a fact of life in the US with the traps having a diameter of small marble.  

But one really easy and mess-proof way to get rid of blocked toilets is just to add detergent and hair conditioner to the mix and leave for a while. 

And if the toilet is not overflowing, after adding the detergent/conditioner, add a pot of hot water to the bowl which will help soften things and help circulate the hair conditioner which will reduce friction between the blockage and the bowl.  (Often calcium/salt deposits from the water basically can leave the bowl like almost sandpaper which snags the paper etc). 

I've never had to resort to toilet snake or plunger since doing this, and everyone who I tell about this has said it works./nIf you're alone or you're afraid of having mistakes in an email, essay, or post, simply paste it in Google Translate and click on the speaker icon to have it read to you. Listening to something allows you to get a flow of the words better and notice any grammatical mistakes.

Edit: yes, reading aloud also works but here's something I agree with from the comments: 
StickiStickman said:
"When you read it out yourself you may misread or your brain may "auto-complete" some words." This causes you to not notice certain mistakes. /nWhether it is at school or at work or even the gym, if you notice that someone acts differently around you, they are probably into you.

Interacting with them will likely relieve the awkwardness, instead of ignoring them.

EDIT: Shyness is also included in this. I meant like as in they can be an acquaintance or even a friend, nothing romantic was implied. I think people need to make a distinction between someone who is a little socially awkward and someone who is a total creep. People in here are thinking about worst case scenarios. This LPT can definitely apply to both genders./nJust be patient. It makes the person feel unvalued for what they have to say./nEdit: As others have pointed out, not everyone has a mother/grandmother who can cook. Essentially it could be extrapolated as "Call your loved ones in reference to things they are good at rather than googling the solution, as it will hopefully make them feel needed and gives you a nice excuse to call." /nRecent cold snaps have motivated me to type this out.

**Clothing:**
*edit: /u/kanadakid19 posted some [great background](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxdam9o) info in regards to clothing and fabric choices.* 

**Layers**. Always dress in layers (and bring layers with you). Not only do layers create more pockets of air (which help insulate), but also allow you to avoiding sweating (which will cool you off the fastest). This also goes for your legs. It might not be sexy, but long underwear or tights underneath your pants will make an enormous difference. High end winter gear creates this by design (down/fur),  try to mimic this functionality with your layers. 

*Edit: Generally you will have three:*

1. Baselayer (thermals/long underwear). Merino wool is go to here, but there are many high-performing synthetics should you find it too pricey. This layer should be quite tight and extremely soft/comfortable, and breathable. It also needs to maintain warmth when wet because this is the one that's going to get sweaty (which is bad, but prepare for it anyway). Semi-related tip: make sure that the combination of your socks/thermals doesn't cut into your skin (you often see this with ski and hiking boots). If you have high quality socks, consider getting thermals that only go down to mid-calf.  
2. Midlayer. On super cold days this can actually be two layers. A breathable fleece/synthetic sweatshirt type layer (see the Arcteryx shirt I linked in the cotton section), and an insulation layer (which is not really breathable). The insulation layer will almost always be some form of down (and will be integrated into heavy parkas). [For this layer I'm really loving the new "synthetic down"](http://www.patagonia.com/us/shop/womens-insulation-synthetic-insulation?k=1E-6V-aY). It's so light and squishy and easy to store when you need to (which is awesome, because this is likely the first layer that you'll want to store). 
3. The wind/waterproof layer (AKA, the shitty weather layer... OK it's actually called the "outer layer" or "shell"). This is where you'll spend the big bucks, but in a pinch, **a goddamn plastic bag is better than nothing**. This layer is stopping windchill and rain **only**. And often, you'll keep the lighter midlayer + this one after you get halfway down your run. Or to work. Or whatever.  

**Loose**. Do **not** restrict your circulation. Especially on your appendages (feet/fingers). Yes, that extra pair of socks might seem like a great idea, but if you have to squish into your boots, I promise that your feet will be colder. Same goes for gloves (mitts are usually better for that reason). But /u/LeoNemean reminds us to make sure you tuck in your long underwear... You are trying to create little sealed bubbles of air between you an the cold (kind of like a thermos).  

**Cotton is the worst**. Jeans, shirts, dress pants whatever. If it isn't wool or synthetic, it will get wet, stay wet, and provide very little insulation even when dry and zero protection from the wind. Avoid at all costs. *Edit: Smartwool and Merino wool are the latest go to (especially for baselayers), but my favourite midlayer is [this hoodie](http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=womens&category=Mid_Layer_and_Fleece&subcat=Athletic&model=Thaleia-Hoody-W). I wear it almost every day, especially after working out. It's great because it still lets the sweat evaporate, but without letting you get cold.*

--------

**Behaviour:**

1. **Protect yourself from the wind**. Yes, cover your ears/face/exposed skin with clothing (toque/scarf/mitts), but also stand in whatever shelter available and walk next to buildings to avoid the wind. It's a myth that you lose more heat from your head than any other body part... but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't cover it like you would any other body part. My father always told me: *You don't need to cover all your extremities, just the ones you want to keep.*
2. **Make the most of the heat you have**. Get dressed inside and wait for all the little pockets of air to warm up before you go outside. 
3. **Do not get wet**. Either from sweat or anything else. Getting wet will give you hypothermia/frostbite in minutes vs hours. If you feel yourself starting to sweat, immediately take off a layer... Or two. Whatever it takes. If it's slushy you're usually better off with $20 gumboots and a good pair of socks, rather than non-waterproof boots. 

*Edit: I'm seeing a lot of posts saying* ***"but but I sweat when I wear.... and then I'm cold".*** 

Sweating is caused by two things:

1. **The breathability of the fabric(s) you're wearing.** This can be rectified largely by spending more money on slightly looser/physically lighter, more insulating, items that wick away moisture. And yes, it is possible to get breathable waterproof winter boots if you spend enough money. And do not cheap out on your socks either. Try cheap alternatives first, but the technology is there if you need an "extreme" solution. 
2. **You aren't removing (or wearing) your layers appropriately.** In order to stay warm your toes, fingers and arms should all be able to move/rest freely and comfortably. If that movement is hampered (say you can't reach in front of you or over your head), likely you have the wrong clothing on. When you step outside you should feel a slight chill that goes away when you start moving. Once you get moving, it's very normal to only have your wind/waterproof shell and your long underwear on... And there have definitely been times where I skied in long underwear and snowpants and removed my coat completely.  

-----------

**Frostbite**

Recognize the symptoms: 

* Stages: [Lethargy in your joints](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd6bun), pain, and numbness. And you'll notice some freaky colour changes. Pain is good... Numbness is not.... but likely you'll have a tough time noticing which parts are numb and which just hurt. If you start feeling pain, you should do something about it. If you see blue, there is likely some tissue damage. **You need to get out of the cold immediately.**  

* Treatment: Understand that while you feel pain, the surface area of your skin is completely numb. You will have no reliable feedback as to what is *actually* hurting you. You can try rubbing the area, but you will not be able to tell if you're damaging the skin. You can try to warm it up with water, but you likely will not be able to tell what temperature the water is. **It is very easy to burn or damage your skin further while it is in the early stages of frostbite and are trying to warm up.** 

And it will hurt a **lot**.  Just be patient and wait. 

**Hypothermia**

Understand that most cases of hypothermia happen without and snow or frost (because people are not prepared). Pouring rain at 45F/8C can be just as deadly. 

Recognize the Symptoms: 

* The shivering/teeth chattering stops. 
* You start to feel sluggish/slow. 
* It's hard to think (you almost feel drunk). 
* And then you feel very very sleepy and not really cold at all...

Treatment: Obviously, get out of the cold and get warm. If this isn't immediately easily available, do the following:

* Get dry (change your clothes and try to dry the wet ones)
* Get out of the wind (build a shelter, crawl under to the base of a tree) and the elements
* Find a source of heat (even a candle in a small shelter [or your car!] can make a huge difference). Do **not** leave your car running (because you won't notice if your exhaust becomes blocked and starts filling your car up with carbon monoxide). 

----------
**Emergency Preparedness**

First and foremost: **Always tell people where you are going --your anticipated route-- and when you'll arrive.** Obviously unnecessary in busy city centres, but for those commuting long distances or taking trips over winter, this is a good [lifesaving] habit to get into. 

Keep this * minimal * emergency kit in your car at all times and all seasons:

* Windproof/insulated gloves + toque
* Rain ponchos
* Plastic bags/garbage bags (they are windproof and decent for keeping your feet and core dry in a pinch)
* Emergency blanket (and sleeping bag if possible)
* Candle + matches/means to light it
* Reflective cones (and glowsticks or flares if possible)
* Multi-tool (letherman) 
* First aid kit
* Energy bars
* An ~~old school~~ accurate paper map of the area

*Edit: /u/8654 reminded me of [a few I missed](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd9og3?context=3). But keep in mind this is a* ***basic*** *kit. If you live in more remote/extreme areas, you need a lot more than what I've listed*.  

* A tow rope
* Salt or sand or kitty litter

And when the worst happens, understand that not all survival/emergency situations are created equal. 

* It may or may not be safest to stay in your vehicle. Generally speaking, you will survive the elements longer if you wait in your car...
* But if your car is anywhere near a major highway, you're also more likely to get hit...
* But even then it's still safer to get hit while in your vehicle, rather than crossing the road on foot ([this recently ended in a terrible tragedy for a canadian politician trying to help a stranded motorist](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/manmeet-bhullar-remembered-prentice-fawcett-nenshi-1.3334178)).

**NEW!Useful Tips**

*I added this section in an edit because a lot have come through.*

* /u/Mcfearsom has some absolutely [awesome tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd1meu) (I learned a few).
* /u/diabolicaldebacle brought up how the 3rd (but less well known/common) way of losing heat [is simply by conduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd47n3). This can come from cold benches at a football stadium/hockey arena, or simply from standing on cement for a long period of time. 
* /u/winterisforhome also reminded me that [pets get cold too!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd336x?context=3) Yes, some breeds have fur that is built to handle the elements, but their feet aren't usually so tough. And I found that [these booties](http://pawzdogboots.com/) are the best way to protect my huskyX's feet from the salt and ice. 
* /u/_kingtut_ reminds us to be aware of the [effect that alcohol can have on the system](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/cxd75zo?context=3) (don't worry, you can still drink, just know what's happening).

*edited some formatting for legibility.*

*Edit#2 Holy balls. Obligatory RIP inbox. Trying to respond to all is getting to be impossible, so I'll edit with some more advice themes and gear suggestions.*

*Edit#9234083 Gah. Front page is a scary place.*

*Edit: Shout out to all Australians, Californians, Texans... Floridians...  that keep reminding us how warm they are:* **WE FUCKING GET IT.** *kthanxbai. <3*

*Edit again: Some people have made some comments alluding to the fact that I may be some sort of product shill and I promise I'm not (other than disclose the fact that I used to work part time for Mark's Work Wearhouse like 10 years ago while I was in uni). All products/stores that I've recommended are just ones that I have experience with... I have absolutely zero financial affiliation in any capacity to any of them.*/n
