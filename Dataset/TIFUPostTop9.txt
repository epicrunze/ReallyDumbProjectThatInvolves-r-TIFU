This literally just happened. I was discussing this subreddit with a guy (we’ll call him M) I’m flirting with... and we come across the hot sauce story, felt like it sounded like our mutual friend (he can be called B)

So I take a screenshot and go to send it on FB messenger to send to B.... muscle memory kicks in and I send the photo so quick my camera roll hadn’t updated... I accidentally sent a nude I’d taken half hour earlier. 

This wouldn’t be an issue usually... but this guy is like a brother figure. He’s not answering his phone so I’ve just spammed the fuck out of the conversation to stop it popping up.

All the while I’m on the phone to M, the initial intended recipient....who is also in a band with B. 


For anyone curious here’s me [trying to claw it back](https://imgur.com/gallery/888ILDh)

TLDR; tried to send a screenshot to a friend. Sent my tits instead.  Ughhhhhhhhhhh

Update: if this gets 666 upvotes I’ll post the photo.

Edit: hi Dan. I know you’re lurking ahahahhaha

Update: I love you all. You’ve cured my depression. Let me be your [big tiddy goth gf](https://imgur.com/a/WqWZqtc)
