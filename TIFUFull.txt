Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. /nThe overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. /nToday was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

Stop giving me gold! I appreciate it but give to charity instead! Heres something different we could do <3

Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

Oh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

TL;DR: His life is ruined./nSo this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

UPDATE: There’s a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. It wasn’t. She was with this guy for 3 years./nRecently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

"Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?"

"Yes, yes and yes!"  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like "what is an ounce?" or "how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?"  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

"Dose size: 1/2 cookie," I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say "Diarrhea?"  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

"You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

"Of course not." I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

"Keep it together, man,"  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

"You are sweating... from your entire face," she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  "Are you alright?" she asks kindly.

"Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy," I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
"Bathroom. Now." she hisses. "Get it together."  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table "for being gone such a long time" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  "Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

"What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago."

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  "HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!" she demands.

"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada," I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  "I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now."

"REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW."

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves "good-bye" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at "getting handsie" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: "Please don't die, we have a mortgage."/nI'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because I'm an idiot. 

My dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us "being strangers." My immediate reply was "oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

Never going back.

TL;DR  Today I fucked up by licking my dentist/nThis happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

OH and thanks for the gold! Things are going so fast here I didnt even see it until now. Thank you unknown and kind strangers!

/nThis literally just happened. I was discussing this subreddit with a guy (we’ll call him M) I’m flirting with... and we come across the hot sauce story, felt like it sounded like our mutual friend (he can be called B)

So I take a screenshot and go to send it on FB messenger to send to B.... muscle memory kicks in and I send the photo so quick my camera roll hadn’t updated... I accidentally sent a nude I’d taken half hour earlier. 

This wouldn’t be an issue usually... but this guy is like a brother figure. He’s not answering his phone so I’ve just spammed the fuck out of the conversation to stop it popping up.

All the while I’m on the phone to M, the initial intended recipient....who is also in a band with B. 


For anyone curious here’s me [trying to claw it back](https://imgur.com/gallery/888ILDh)

TLDR; tried to send a screenshot to a friend. Sent my tits instead.  Ughhhhhhhhhhh

Update: if this gets 666 upvotes I’ll post the photo.

Edit: hi Dan. I know you’re lurking ahahahhaha

Update: I love you all. You’ve cured my depression. Let me be your [big tiddy goth gf](https://imgur.com/a/WqWZqtc)

Edit: Oh my god gold!!!!!
